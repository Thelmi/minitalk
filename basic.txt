INTRODUCTION 


There is a Need 

Does school prepare children for the real world? “Study hard and get good grades and you will 
find a high-paying job with great benefits,” my parents used to say. Their goal in life was to 
provide a college education for my older sister and me, so that we would have the greatest 
chance for success in life. When I finally earned my diploma in 1976-graduating with honors, 
and near the top of my class, in accounting from Florida State University-my parents had 
realized their goal. It was the crowning achievement of their lives. In accordance with the 
“Master Plan,” I was hired by a “Big 8” accounting firm, and I looked forward to a long career 
and retirement at an early age. 

My husband, Michael, followed a similar path. We both came from hardworking families, of 
modest means but with strong work ethics. Michael also graduated with honors, but he did it 
twice: first as an engineer and then from law school. He was quickly recruited by a prestigious 
Washington, D.C., law firm that specialized in patent law, and his future seemed bright, career 
path well-defined and early retirement guaranteed. 

Although we have been successful in our careers, they have not turned out quite as we 
expected. We both have changed positions several times-for all the right reasons-but there are 
no pension plans vesting on our behalf. Our retirement funds are growing only through our 
individual contributions. 

Michael and I have a wonderful marriage with three great children. As I write this, two are in 
college and one is just beginning high school. We have spent a fortune making sure our children 
have received the best education available. 

One day in 1996, one of my children came home disillusioned with school. He was bored and 
tired of studying. “Why should I put time into studying subjects I will never use in real life?” he 
protested. 

Without thinking, I responded, “Because if you don’t get good grades, you won’t get into 
college.” “Regardless of whether 1 go to college,” he replied, “I’m going to be rich.” 

“If you don’t graduate from college, you won’t get a good job,” I responded with a tinge of panic 
and motherly concern. “And if you don’t have a good job, how do you plan to get rich?” 

My son smirked and slowly shook his head with mild boredom. We have had this talk many 
times before. He lowered his head and rolled his eyes. My words of motherly wisdom were 
falling on deaf ears once again. 

Though smart and strong-willed, he has always been a polite and respectful young man. 

“Mom,” he began. It was my turn to be lectured. “Get with the times! Look around; the richest 
people didn’t get rich because of their educations. Look at Michael Jordan and Madonna. Even 
Bill Gates, who dropped out of Harvard, founded Microsoft; he is now the richest man in

America, and he’s still in his 30s. There is a baseball pitcher who makes more than $4 million a 
year even though he has been labeled ‘mentally challenged.’ ” 

There was a long silence between us. It was dawning on me that 1 was giving my son the same 
advice my parents had given me. The world around us has changed, but the advice hasn’t. 

Getting a good education and making good grades no longer ensures success, and nobody 
seems to have noticed, except our children. 

“Mom,” he continued, “I don’t want to work as hard as you and dad do. You make a lot of 
money, and we live in a huge house with lots of toys. If I follow your advice, I'll wind up like you, 
working harder and harder only to pay more taxes and wind up in debt. There is no job security 
anymore; I know all about downsizing and rightsizing. I also know that college graduates today 
earn less than you did when you graduated. Look at doctors. They don’t make nearly as much 
money as they used to. I know I can’t rely on Social Security or company pensions for 
retirement. I need new answers.” 

He was right. He needed new answers, and so did I. My parents’ advice may have worked for 
people born before 1945, but it may be disastrous for those of us born into a rapidly changing 
world. No longer can I simply say to my children, 

“Go to school, get good grades, and look for a safe, secure job.” 

I knew I had to look for new ways to guide my children’s education. 

As a mother as well as an accountant, I have been concerned by the lack of financial education 
our children receive in school. Many of today’s youth have credit cards before they leave high 
school, yet they have never had a course in money or how to invest it, let alone understand how 
compound interest works on credit cards. Simply put, without financial literacy and the 
knowledge of how money works, they are not prepared to face the world that awaits them, a 
world in which spending is emphasized over savings. 

When my oldest son became hopelessly in debt with his credit cards as a freshman in college, I 
not only helped him destroy the credit cards, but I also went in search of a program that would 
help me educate my children on financial matters. 

One day last year, my husband called me from his office. “I have someone I think you should 
meet,” he said. “His name is Robert Kiyosaki. He’s a businessman and investor, and he is here 
applying for a patent on an educational product. I think it’s what you have been looking for.” 

Just What I Was Looking For 

My husband, Mike, was so impressed with CASHFLOW, the new educational product that 
Robert Kiyosaki was developing, that he arranged for both of us to participate in a test of the 
prototype. Because it was an educational game, I also asked my 19-year-old daughter, who was 
a freshman at a local university, if she would like to take part, and she agreed. 

About fifteen people, broken into three groups, participated in the test. 

Mike was right. It was the educational product I had been looking for. But it had a twist: It 


Page 3/114

Robert T. Kiyosaki 


looked like a colorful Monopoly board with a giant well-dressed rat in the middle. Unlike 
Monopoly, however, there were two tracks: one inside and one outside. The object of the game 
was to get out of the inside track-what Robert called the “Rat Race” and reach the outer track, 
or the “Fast Track.” As Robert put it, the Fast Track simulates how rich people play in real life. 

Robert then defined the “Rat Race” for us. 

"If you look at the life of the average -educated, hard-working person, there is a similar path. The 
child is born and goes to school. The proud parents are excited because the child excels, gets 
fair to good grades, and is accepted into a college. The child graduates, maybe goes on to 
graduate school and then does exactly as programmed: looks for a safe, secure job or career. 
The child finds that job, maybe as a doctor or a lawyer, or joins the Army or works for the 
government. Generally, the child begins to make money, credit cards start to arrive in mass, and 
the shopping begins, if it already hasn’t. 

"Having money to burn, the child goes to places where other young people just like them hang 
out, and they meet people, they date, and sometimes they get married. Life is wonderful now, 
because today, both men and women work. Two incomes are bliss. They feel successful, their 
future is bright, and they decide to buy a house, a car, a television, take vacations and have 
children. The happy bundle arrives. The demand for cash is enormous. The happy couple 
decides that their careers are vitally important and begin to work harder, seeking promotions 
and raises. The raises come, and so does another child and the need for a bigger house. They 
work harder, become better employees, even more dedicated. They go back to school to get 
more specialized skills so they can earn more money. Maybe they take a second job. Their 
incomes go up, but so does the tax bracket they’re in and the real estate taxes on their new 
large home, and their Social Security taxes, and all the other taxes. They get their large 
paycheck and wonder where all the money went. They buy some mutual funds and buy 
groceries with their credit card. The children reach 5 or 6 years of age, and the need to save for 
college increases as well as the need to save for their retirement. . 

"That happy couple, born 35 years ago, is now trapped in the Rat Race for the rest of their 
working days. They work for the owners of their company, for the government paying taxes, 
and for the bank paying off a mortgage and credit cards. 

“Then, they advise their own children to ‘study hard, get good grades, and find a safe job or 
career.’ They learn nothing about money, except from those who profit from their naivete, and 
work hard all their lives. The process repeats into another hard-working generation. This is the 
‘Rat Race’.” 

The only way to get out of the “Rat Race” is to prove your proficiency at both accounting and 
investing, arguably two of the most difficult subjects to master. As a trained CPA who once 
worked for a Big 8 accounting firm, I was surprised that Robert had made the learning of these 
two subjects both fun and exciting. The process was so well disguised that while we were 
diligently working to get out of the “Rat Race,” we quickly forgot we were learning. 

Soon a product test turned into a fun afternoon with my daughter, talking about things we had 
never discussed before. As an accountant, playing a game that required an Income Statement 
and Balance Sheet was easy. So I had the time to help my daughter and the other players at my 


Page 4/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


table with concepts they did not understand. I was the first person-and the only person in the 
entire test group-to get out of the “Rat Race” that day. I was out within 50 minutes, although 
the game went on for nearly three hours. 

At my table was a banker, a business owner and a computer programmer. What greatly 
disturbed me was how little these people knew about either accounting or investing, subjects so 
important in their lives. I wondered how they managed their own financial affairs in real life. I 
could understand why my 19-year-old daughter would not understand, but these were grown 
adults, at least twice her age. 

After I was out of the “Rat Race,” for the next two hours I watched my daughter and these 
educated, affluent adults roll the dice and move their markers. Although I was glad they were all 
learning so much, I was disturbed by how much the adults did not know about the basics of 
simple accounting and investing. They had difficulty grasping the relationship between their 
Income Statement and their Balance Sheet. As they bought and sold assets, they had trouble 
remembering that each transaction could impact their monthly cash flow. I thought, how many 
millions of people are out there in the real world struggling financially, only because they have 
never been taught these subjects? 

Thank goodness they’re having fun and are distracted by the desire to win the game, I said to 
myself. After Robert ended the contest, he allowed us fifteen minutes to discuss and critique 
CASHFLOW among ourselves. 

The business owner at my table was not happy. He did not like the game. "I don’t need to know 
this,” he said out loud. “I hire accountants, bankers and attorneys to tell me about this stuff.” 

To which Robert replied, “Have you ever noticed that there are a lot of accountants who aren’t 
rich? And bankers, and attorneys, and stockbrokers and real estate brokers. They know a lot, 
and for the most part are smart people, but most of them are not rich. Since our schools do not 
teach people what the rich know, we take advice from these people. But one day, you’re 
driving down the highway, stuck in traffic, struggling to get to work, and you look over to your 
right and you see your accountant stuck in the same traffic jam. You look to your left and you 
see your banker. That should tell you something.” 

The computer programmer was also unimpressed by the game: “I can buy software to teach me 
this.” 

The banker, however, was moved. “I studied this in school-the accounting part, that is-but I 
never knew how to apply it to real life. Now I know. I need to get myself out of the ‘Rat Race.’ ” 

But it was my daughter’s comments that most touched me. “I had fun learning,” she said. “I 
learned a lot about how money really works and how to invest.” 

Then she added: “Now I know I can choose a profession for the work I want to perform and not 
because of job security, benefits or howmuch I get paid. If I learn what this game teaches, I’m 
free to do and study what my heart wants to study. . .rather than study something because 
businesses are looking for certain job skills. If I learn this, I won’t have to worry about job 
security and Social Security the way most of my classmates already do.”

I was not able to stay and talk with Robert after we had played the game, but we agreed to meet 
later to further discuss his project. I knew he wanted to use the game to help others become 
more financially sawy, and I was eager to hear more about his plans. 

My husband and I set up a dinner meeting with Robert and his wife within the next week. 
Although it was our first social get-together, we felt as if we had known each other for years. 

We found out we had a lot in common. We covered the gamut, from sports and plays to 
restaurants and socio-economic issues. We talked about the changing world. We spent a lot of 
time discussing how most Americans have little or nothing saved for retirement, as well as the 
almost bankrupt state of Social Security and Medicare. Would my children be required to pay for 
the retirement of 75 million baby boomers? We wondered if people realize how risky it is to 
depend on a pension plan. 

Robert’s primary concern was the growing gap between the haves and have nots, in America 
and around the world. A self-taught, self-made entrepreneur who traveled the world putting 
investments together, Robert was able to retire at the age of 47. He came out of retirement 
because he shares the same concern I have for my own children. He knows that the world has 
changed, but education has not changed with it. According to Robert, children spend years in an 
antiquated educational system, studying subjects they will never use, preparing for a world that 
no longer exists. 

“Today, the most dangerous advice you can give a child is ‘Go to school, get good grades and 
look for a safe secure job,’ ” he likes to say. “That is old advice, and it’s bad advice. If you could 
see what is happening in Asia, Europe, South America, you would be as concerned as I am.” 

It’s bad advice, he believes, “because if you want your child to have a financially secure future, 
they can’t play by the old set of rules. It’s just too risky.” 

I asked him what he meant by “old rules?” . 

“People like me play by a different set of rules from what you play by,” he said. “What happens 
when a corporation announces a downsizing?” 

“People get laid off,” I said. "Families are hurt. Unemployment goes 

M 

up. 

“Yes, but what happens to the company, in particular a public company on the stock 
exchange?” 

“The price of the stock usually goes up when the downsizing is announced,” I said. “The market 
likes it when a company reduces its labor costs, either through automation or just consolidating 
the labor force in general.” 

“That’s right,” he said. “And when stock prices go up, people like me, the shareholders, get 
richer. That is what I mean by a different set of rules. Employees lose; owners and investors 
win.” 

Robert was describing not only the difference between an employee and employer, but also the 


Page 6/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


difference between controlling your own destiny and giving up that control to someone else. 

“But it’s hard for most people to understand why that happens,” I said. “They just think it’s not 
fair.” 

“That’s why it is foolish to simply say to a child, ‘Get a good education,’ ” he said. “It is foolish 
to assume that the education the school system provides will prepare your children for the world 
they will face upon graduation. Each child needs more education. Different education. And they 
need to know the rules. The different sets of rules.” 

“There are rules of money that the rich play by, and there are the rules that the other 95 
percent of the population plays by,” he said. “And the 95 percent learns those rules at home 
and in school. That is why it’s risky today to simply say to a child, ‘Study hard and look for a job.’ 
A child today needs a more sophisticated education, and the current system is not delivering the 
goods. I don’t care how many computers they put in the classroom or how much money schools 
spend. How can the education system teach a subject that it does not know?” 

So how does a parent teach their children, what the school does not? How do you teach 
accounting to a child? Won’t they get bored? And how do you teach investing when as a parent 
you yourself are risk averse? Instead of teaching my children to simply play it safe, I decided it 
was best to teach them to play it smart. 

“So how would you teach a child about money and all the things we’ve talked about?” I asked 
Robert. “How can we make it easy for parents especially when they don’t understand it 
themselves?” 

“I wrote a book on the subject, ” he said. 

“Where is it?” 

“In my computer. It’s been there for years in random pieces. I add to it occasionally but I’ve 
never gotten around to put it all together. I began writing it after my other book became a best 
seller, but I never finished the new one. It’s in pieces.” 

And in pieces it was. After reading the scattered sections, I decided the book had merit and 
needed to be shared, especially in these changing times. We agreed to co-author Robert’s book. 

I asked him how much financial information he thought a child needed. He said it would depend 
on the child. He knew at a young age that he wanted to be rich and was fortunate enough to 
have a father figure who was rich and willing to guide him. Education is the foundation of 
success, Robert said. Just as scholastic skills are vitally important, so are financial skills and 
communication skills. 

What follows is the story of Robert’s two dads, a rich one and a poor 

one, that expounds on the skills he’s developed over a lifetime. The contrast between two dads 
provides an important perspective. The book is supported, edited and assembled by me. For 
any accountants who read this book, suspend your academic book knowledge and open your 
mind to the theories Robert presents. Although many of them challenge the very fundamentals 
of generally accepted accounting principles, they provide a valuable insight into the way true

investors analyze their investment decisions. 

When we as parents advise our children to “go to school, study hard and get a good job,” we 
often do that out of cultural habit. It has always been the right thing to do. When I met Robert, 
his ideas initially startled me. Having been raised by two fathers, he had been taught to strive for 
two different goals. His educated dad advised him to work for a corporation. His rich dad 
advised him to own the corporation. Both life paths required education, but the subjects of study 
were completely different. His educated dad encouraged Robert to be a smart person. His rich 
dad encouraged Robert to know how to hire smart people. 

Having two dads caused many problems. Robert’s real dad was the superintendent of education 
for the state of Hawaii. By the time Robert was 16, the threat of “If you don’t get good grades, 
you won’t get a good job” had little effect. He already knew his career path was to own 
corporations, not to work for them. In fact, if it had not been for a wise and persistent high 
school guidance counselor, Robert might not have gone on to college. He admits that. He was 
eager to start building his assets, but finally agreed that the college education would also be a 
benefit to him. 

Truthfully, the ideas in this book are probably too far fetched and radical for most parents today. 
Some parents are having a hard enough time simply keeping their children in school. But in 
light of our changing times, as parents we need to be open to new and bold ideas. To 
encourage children to be employees is to advise your children to pay more than their fair share 
of taxes over a lifetime, with little or no promise of a pension. And it is true that taxes are a 
person’s greatest expense. In fact, most families work from January to mid-May for the 
government just to cover their taxes. New ideas are needed and this book provides them. 

Robert claims that the rich teach their children differently. They teach their children at home, 
around the dinner table. These ideas may notbe the ideas you choose to discuss with your 
children, but thank you for looking at them. And I advise you to keep searching. In my opinion, 
as a mom and a CPA, the concept of simply getting good grades and finding a good job is an old 
idea. We need to advise our children with a greater degree of sophistication. We need new 
ideas and different education. Maybe telling our children to strive to be good employees while 
also striving to own their own investment corporation is not such a bad idea. 

It is my hope as a mother that this book helps other parents. It is Robert’s hope to inform 
people that anyone can achieve prosperity if they choose so. If today you are a gardener or a 
janitor or even unemployed, you have the ability to educate yourself and teach those you love to 
take care of themselves financially. Remember that financial intelligence is the mental process 
via which we solve our financial problems. 

Today we are facing global and technological changes as great or even greater than those ever 
faced before. No one has a crystal ball, but one thing is for certain: Changes lie ahead that are 
beyond our reality. Who knows what the future brings? But whatever happens, we have two 
fundamental choices: play it safe or play it smart by preparing, getting educated and awakening 
your own and your children’s financial genius. - Sharon Lechter

CHAPTER ONE 


Rich Dad, Poor Dad 
As narrated by Robert Kiyosaki 

I had two fathers, a rich one and a poor one. One was highly educated and intelligent; he had a 
Ph.D. and completed four years of undergraduate work in less than two years. He then went on 
to Stanford University, the University of Chicago, and Northwestern University to do his 
advanced studies, all on full financial scholarships. The other father never finished the eighth 
grade . 

Both men were successful in their careers, working hard all their lives. Both earned substantial 
incomes. Yet one struggled financially all his life. The other would become one of the richest 
men in Hawaii. One died leaving tens of millions of dollars to his family, charities and his church. 
The other left bills to be paid. 

Both men were strong, charismatic and influential. Both men offered me advice, but they did 
not advise the same things. Both men believed strongly in education but did not recommend the 
same course of study. 

If 1 had had only one dad, I would have had to accept or reject his advice. Having two dads 
advising me offered me the choice of contrasting points of view; one of a rich man and one of a 
poor man. 

Instead of simply accepting or rejecting one or the other, I found myself thinking more, 
comparing and then choosing for myself. 

The problem was, the rich man was not rich yet and the poor man not yet poor. Both were just 
starting out on their careers, and both were struggling with money and families. But they had 
very different points of view about the subject of money. 

For example, one dad would say, “The love of money is the root of all evil.” The other, “The 
lack of money is the root of all evil.” 

As a young boy, having two strong fathers both influencing me was difficult. I wanted to be a 
good son and listen, but the two fathers did not say the same things. The contrast in their points 
of view, particularly where money was concerned, was so extreme that I grew curious and 
intrigued. I began to start thinking for long periods of time about what each was saying. 

Much of my private time was spent reflecting, asking myself questions such as, “Why does he 
say that?” and then asking the same question of the other dad’s statement. It would have been 
much easier to simply say, “Yeah, he’s right. I agree with that.” Or to simply reject the point of 
view by saying, “The old man doesn’t know what he’s talking about.” Instead, having two dads 
whom I loved forced me to think and ultimately choose a way of thinking for myself. As a 
process, choosing for myself turned out to be much more valuable in the long run, rather than 
simply accepting or rejecting a single point of view.

One of the reasons the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the middle class struggles in 
debt is because the subject of money is taught at home, not in school. Most of us learn about 
money from our parents. So what can a poor parent tell their child about money? They simply 
say “Stay in school and study hard.” The child may graduate with excellent grades but with a 
poor person’s financial programming and mind-set. It was learned while the child was young. 

Money is not taught in schools. Schools focus on scholastic and professional skills, but not on 
financial skills. This explains how smart bankers, doctors and accountants who earned excellent 
grades in school may still struggle financially all of their lives. Our staggering national debt is due 
in large part to highly educated politicians and government officials making financial decisions 
with little or no training on the subject of money. 

I often look ahead to the new millennium and wonder what will happen when we have millions 
of people who will need financial and medical assistance. They will be dependent on their 
families or the government for financial support. What will happen when Medicare and Social 
Security run out of money? How will a nation survive if teaching children about money continues 
to be left to parents-most of whom will be, or already are, poor? 

Because I had two influential fathers, I learned from both of them. I had to think about each 
dad’s advice, and in doing so, I gained valuable insight into the power and effect of one’s 
thoughts on one’s life. For example, one dad had a habit of saying, “I can’t afford it.” The other 
dad forbade those words to be used. He insisted I say, “How can I afford it?” One is a 
statement, and the other is a question. One lets you off the hook, and the other forces you to 
think. My soon-to-be-rich dad would explain that by automatically saying the words “I can’t 
afford it,” your brain stops working. By asking the question “How can I afford it?” your brain is 
put to work. He did not mean buy everything you wanted. He was fanatical about exercising 
your mind, the most powerful computer in the world. “My brain gets stronger every day because 
I exercise it. The stronger it gets, the more money I can make.” He believed that automatically 
saying “I can’t afford it” was a sign of mental laziness. 

Although both dads worked hard, I noticed that one dad had a habit of putting his brain to sleep 
when it came to money matters, and the other had a habit of exercising his brain. The long- 
term result was that one dad grew stronger financially and the other grew weaker. It is not much 
different from a person who goes to the gym to exercise on a regular basis versus someone who 
sits on the couch watching television. Proper physical exercise increases your chances for 
health, and proper mental exercise increases your chances for wealth. Laziness decreases both 
health and wealth. 

My two dads had opposing attitudes in thought. One dad thought that the rich should pay more 
in taxes to take care of those less fortunate. The other said, “Taxes punish those who produce 
and reward those who don’t produce.” 

One dad recommended, “Study hard so you can find a good company to work for.” The other 
recommended, “Study hard so you can find a good company to buy.” One dad said, “The 
reason I’m not rich is because 1 have you kids.” The other said, “The reason I must be rich is 
because I have you kids.” One encouraged talking about money and business at the dinner table. 
The other forbade the subject of money to be discussed over a meal. One said, “When it comes 


Page 11/114 


http : / / motsach . info

Robert T. Kiyosaki 


to money, play it safe, don’t take risks.” The other said, “Learn to manage risk.” 

One believed, “Our home is our largest investment and our greatest asset.” The other believed, 
“My house is a liability, and if your house is your largest investment, you’re in trouble.” 

Both dads paid their bills on time, yet one paid his bills first while the other paid his bills last. 

One dad believed in a company or the government taking care of you and your needs. He was 
always concerned about pay raises, retirement plans, medical benefits, sick leave, vacation days 
and other perks. He was impressed with two of his uncles who joined the military and earned a 
retirement and entitlement package for life after twenty years of active service. He loved the 
idea of medical benefits and PX privileges the military provided its retirees. He also loved the 
tenure system available through the university. The idea of job protection for life and job 
benefits seemed more important, at times, than the job. He would often say, “I’ve worked hard 
for the government, and I’m entitled to these benefits.” 

The other believed in total financial self-reliance. He spoke out against the “entitlement” 
mentality and how it was creating weak and financially needy people. He was emphatic about 
being financially competent. 

One dad struggled to save a few dollars. The other simply created investments. 

One dad taught me how to write an impressive resume so I could find a good job. The other 
taught me how to write strong business and financial plans so I could create jobs. 

Being a product of two strong dads allowed me the luxury of observing the effects different 
thoughts have on one’s life. I noticed that people really do shape their life through their 
thoughts. 

For example, my poor dad always said, “I’ll never be rich.” And that prophesy became reality. 
My rich dad, on the other hand, always referred to himself as rich. He would say things like, 
“I’m a rich man, and rich people don’t do this.” Even when he was flat broke after a major 
financial setback, he continued to refer to himself as a rich man. He would cover himself by 
saying, “There is a difference between being poor and being broke. - Broke is temporary, and 
poor is eternal.” 

My poor dad would also say, “I’m not interested in money,” or “Money doesn’t matter.” My rich 
dad always said, “Money is power.” 

The power of our thoughts may never be measured or appreciated, but it became obvious to me 
as a young boy to be aware of my thoughts and how I expressed myself. I noticed that my poor 
dad was poor not because of the amount of money he earned, which was significant, but 
because of his thoughts and actions. As a young boy, having two fathers, I became acutely 
aware of being careful which thoughts I chose to adopt as my own. Whom should I listen to-my 
rich dad or my poor dad? 

Although both men had tremendous respect for education and learning, they disagreed in what 
they thought was important to learn. One wanted me to study hard, earn a degree and get a 
good job to work for money. He wanted me to study to become a professional, an attorney or 
an accountant or to go to business school for my MBA. The other encouraged me to study to be

rich, to understand how money works and to learn how to have it work for me. “I don’t work for 
money!” were words he would repeat over and over, “Money works for me!” 

At the age of 9, I decided to listen to and learn from my rich dad about money. In doing so, I 
chose not to listen to my poor dad, even though he was the one with all the college degrees. 

A Lesson From Robert Frost 

Robert Frost is my favourite poet. Although I love many of his poems, my favorite is The Road 
Not Taken. I use its lesson almost daily: 

The Road Not Taken 

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both. And be one traveler, 
long I stood. And looked down one as far as I could. To where it bent in the undergrowth; 

Then took the other, as just as fair. And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy 
and wanted wear. Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same, 

And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for 
another day! Yet knowing how way leads onto way, I doubted if I should ever come back. 

I shall be telling this with a sigh. Somewhere ages and ages hence; Two roads diverged in a 
wood, and I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference. 

Robert Frost(1916) 

And that made all the difference. 

Over the years, I have often reflected upon Robert Frost’s poem. Choosing not to listen to my 
highly educated dad’s advice and attitude about money was a painful decision, but it was a 
decision that shaped the rest of my life. 

Once I made up my mind whom to listen to, my education about money began. My rich dad 
taught me over a period of 30 years, until I was age 39. He stopped once he realized that I 
knew and fully understood what he had been trying to drum into my often thick skull. 

Money is one form of power. But what is more powerful is financial education. Money comes 
and goes, but if you have the education about how money works, you gain power over it and 
can begin building wealth. The reason positive thinking alone does not work is because most 
people went to school and never learned how money works, so they spend their lives working 
for money. 

Because I was only 9 years old when I started, the lessons my rich dad taught me were simple. 
And when it was all said and done, there were only six main lessons, repeated over 30 years. 
This book is about those six lessons, put as simply as possible as my rich dad put forth those 
lessons to me. The lessons are not meant to be answers but guideposts. Guideposts that will 
assist you and your children to grow wealthier no matter what happens in a world of increasing 
change and uncertainty.

CHAPTER TWO 


Lesson One: The Rich Don’t Work For Money 
“Dad, Can You Tell Me How to Get Rich?” 

My dad put down the evening paper. “Why do you want to get rich, son?” 

“Because today Jimmy’s mom drove up in their new Cadillac, and they were going to their 
beach house for the weekend. He took three of his friends, but Mike and I weren’t invited. They 
told us we weren’t invited because we were ‘poor kids’.” 

“They did?” my dad asked incredulously. 

“Yeah, they did.” I replied in a hurt tone. 

My dad silently shook his head, pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and went back to 
reading the paper. I stood waiting for an answer. 

The year was 1956. 1 was 9 years old. By some twist of fate, 1 attended the same public school 
where the rich people sent their kids. We were primarily a sugar plantation town. The managers 
of the plantation and the other affluent people of the town, such as doctors, business owners, 
and bankers, sent their children to this school, grades 1 to 6. After grade 6, their children were 
generally sent off to private schools. Because my family lived on one side of the street, I went to 
this school. Had I lived on the other side of the street, I would have gone to a different school, 
with kids from families more like mine. After grade 6, these kids and I would go on to the public 
intermediate and high school. There was no private school for them or for me. 

My dad finally put down the paper. I could tell he was thinking. 

“Well, son,” he began slowly. “If you want to be rich, you have to learn to make money.” 

“How do I make money?” I asked. 

“Well, use your head, son,” he said, smiling. Which really meant, “That’s all I’m going to tell 
you,” or “1 don’t know the answer, so don’t embarrass me.” 

A Partnership Is Formed 

The next morning, I told my best friend, Mike, what my dad had said. As best I could tell, Mike 
and I were the only poor kids in this school. Mike was like me in that he was in this school by a 
twist of fate. Someone had drawn a jog in the line for the school district, and we wound up in 
school with the rich kids. We weren’t really poor, but we felt as if we were because all the other 
boys had new baseball gloves, new bicycles, new everything. 

Mom and dad provided us with the basics, like food, shelter, clothes. :, But that was about it. My 
dad used to say, “If you want something, work for it.” We wanted things, but there was not 
much work available for 9- , year-old boys.

“So what do we do to make money?” Mike asked. 

“I don’t know,” I said. “But do you want to be my partner?” 

He agreed and so on that Saturday morning, Mike became my first business partner. We spent 
all morning coming up with ideas on how to make money. Occasionally we talked about all the 
“cool guys” at Jimmy’s beach house having fun. It hurt a little, but that hurt was good, for it 
inspired us to keep thinking of a way to make money. Finally, that afternoon, a bolt of lightning 
came through our heads. It was an idea Mike had gotten from a science book he had read. 
Excitedly, we shook hands, and the partnership now had a business. 

For the next several weeks, Mike and I ran around our neighborhood, knocking on doors and 
asking our neighbors if they would save their toothpaste tubes for us. With puzzled looks, most 
adults consented with a smile. Some asked us what we were doing. To which we replied, “We 
can’t tell you. It’s a business secret.” 

My mom grew distressed as the weeks wore on. We had selected a site next to her washing 
machine as the place we would stockpile our raw materials. In a brown cardboard box that one 
time held catsup bottles, our little pile of used toothpaste tubes began to grow. 

Finally my mom put her foot down. The sight of her neighbors’ messy, crumpled used 
toothpaste tubes had gotten to her. “What are you boys doing?” she asked. “And I don’t want to 
hear again that it’s a business secret. Do something with this mess or I’m going to throw it out.” 

Mike and 1 pleaded and begged, explaining that we would soon have enough and then we would 
begin production. We informed her that we were waiting on a couple of neighbors to finish 
using up their toothpaste so we could have their tubes. Mom granted us a one-week extension. 

The date to begin production was moved up. The pressure was on. My first partnership was 
already being threatened with an eviction notice from our warehouse space by my own mom. It 
became Mike’s job to tell the neighbors to quickly use up their toothpaste, saying their dentist 
wanted them to brush more often anyway. I began to put together the production line. 

One day my dad drove up with a friend to see two 9-year-old boys in the driveway with a 
production line operating at full speed. There was fine white powder everywhere. On a long 
table were small milk cartons from school, and our family’s hibachi grill was glowing with red hot 
coals at maximum heat. 

Dad walked up cautiously, having to park the car at the base of the driveway, since the 
production line blocked the carport. As he and his friend got closer, they saw a steel pot sitting 
on top of the coals, with the toothpaste tubes being melted down. In those days, toothpaste did 
not come in plastic tubes. The tubes were made of lead. So once the paint was burned off, the 
tubes were dropped in the small steel pot, melted until they became liquid, and with my mom’s 
pot holders we were pouring the lead through a small hole in the top of the milk cartons. 

The milk cartons were filled with plaster-of-Paris. The white powder everywhere was the plaster 
before we mixed it with water. In my haste, I had knocked the bag over, and the entire area 
look like it had been hit by a snowstorm. The milk cartons were the outer containers for plaster- 
of-Paris molds.

My dad and his friend watched as we carefully poured the molten lead through a small hole in 
the top of the plaster-of-Paris cube. 

“Careful,” my dad said. 

I nodded without looking up. 

Finally, once the pouring was through, I put the steel pot down and smiled at my dad. 

“What are you boys doing?” he asked with a cautious smile. 

“We’re doing what you told me to do. We’re going to be rich,” I said. 

“Yup,” said Mike, grinning and nodding his head. “We’re partners.” 

“And what is in those plaster molds?” dad asked. 

“Watch,” I said. “This should be a good batch.” 

With a small hammer, I tapped at the seal that divided the cube in 

half. Cautiously, I pulled up the top half of the plaster mold and a lead nickel fell out." 

“Oh, my God!” my dad said. “You’re casting nickels out of lead.” 

“That’s right,” Mike said. “We doing as you told us to do. We’re making money.” 

My dad’s friend turned and burst into laughter. My dad smiled and shook his head. Along with a 
fire and a box of spent toothpaste tubes, in front of him were two little boys covered with white 
dust and smiling from ear to ear. 

He asked us to put everything down and sit with him on the front step of our house. With a 
smile, he gently explained what the word “counterfeiting” meant. 

Our dreams were dashed. “You mean this is illegal?” asked Mike in a 

quivering voice. 

“Let them go,” my dad’s friend said. “They might be developing a natural talent.” 

My dad glared at him. 

“Yes, it is illegal,” my dad said gently. “But you boys have shown great creativity and original 
thought. Keep going. I’m really proud of you!" 

Disappointed, Mike and I sat in silence for about twenty minutes before we began cleaning up 
our mess. The business was over on opening day. Sweeping the powder up, I looked at Mike 
and said, “I guess Jimmy and his friends are right. We are poor.” 

My father was just leaving as I said that. “Boys,” he said. "You’re only poor if you give up. The 
most important thing is that you did something. Most people only talk and dream of getting rich. 
You’ve done something. I'm very proud of the two of you. I will say it again.

Keep going. Don’t quit." 

Mike and I stood there in silence. They were nice words, but we still did not know what to do. 
“So how come you’re not rich, dad?” I asked. 

“Because I chose to be a school teacher. School teachers really don’t think about being rich. We 
just like to teach. I wish I could help you, but 1 really don’t know how to make money.” 

Mike and I turned and continued our clean up. 

“I know,” said my dad. “If you boys want to learn how to be rich, don’t ask me. Talk to your 
dad, Mike.” 

“My dad?” asked Mike with a scrunched up face. 

“Yeah, your dad,” repeated my dad with a smile. “Your dad and I have the same banker, and he 
raves about your father. He’s told me several times that your father is brilliant when it comes to 
making money.” 

“My dad?” Mike asked again in disbelief. “Then how come we don’t have a nice car and a nice 
house like the rich kids at school?” 

“A nice car and a nice house does not necessarily mean you’re rich or you know how to make 
money,” my dad replied. “Jimmy’s dad works for the sugar plantation. He’s not much different 
from me. He works for a company, and I work for the government. The company buys the car 
for him. The sugar company is in financial trouble, and Jimmy’s dad may soon have nothing. 
Your dad is different Mike. He seems to be building an empire, and I suspect in a few years he 
will be a very rich man.” 

With that, Mike and I got excited again. With new vigor, we began cleaning up the mess caused 
by our now defunct first business. As we were cleaning, we made plans on how and when to talk 
to Mike’s dad. The problem was that Mike’s dad worked long hours and often did not come 
home until late. His father owned warehouses, a construction company, a chain of stores, and 
three restaurants. It was the restaurants that kept him out late. 

Mike caught the bus home after we had finished cleaning up. He was going to talk to his dad 
when he got home that night and ask him if he would teach us how to become rich. Mike 
promised to call as soon as he had talked to his dad, even if it was late. 

The phone rang at 8:30 p.m. 

“OK,” I said. “Next Saturday.” And put the phone down. Mike’s dad had agreed to meet with 
Mike and me. 

At 7:30 Saturday morning, I caught the bus to the poor side of town. 

The Lessons Begin: 

“I’ll pay you 10 cents an hour. 

Even by 1956 pay standards, 10 cents an hour was low.

Michael and I met with his dad that morning at 8 o’clock. He was already busy and had been at 
work for more than an hour. His construction supervisor was just leaving in his pickup truck as I 
walked up to his simple, small and tidy home. Mike met me at the door. 

“Dad’s on the phone, and he said to wait on the back porch,” Mike said as he opened the door. 

The old wooden floor creaked as I stepped across the threshold of this aging house. There was 
a cheap mat just inside the door. The mat was there to hide the years of wear from countless 
footsteps that the floor had supported. Although clean, it needed to be replaced. 

I felt claustrophobic as I entered the narrow living room, which was filled with old musty 
overstuffed furniture that today would be collector’s items. Sitting on the couch were two 
women, a little older than my mom. Across from the women sat a man in workman’s clothes. 
He wore khaki slacks and a khaki shirt, neatly pressed but without starch, and polished work 
books. He was about 10 years older than my dad; I’d say about 45 years old. They smiled as 
Mike and I walked past them, heading for the kitchen, which lead to the porch that overlooked 
the back yard. I smiled back shyly. 

“Who are those people?” I asked. 

“Oh, they work for my dad. The older man runs his warehouses, and the women are the 
managers of the restaurants. And you saw the construction supervisor, who is working on a road 
project about 50 miles from here. His other supervisor, who is building a track of houses, had 
already left before you got here.” 

“Does this go on all the time?” I asked. 

“Not always, but quite often,” said Mike, smiling as he pulled up a chair to sit down next to me. 

“I asked him if he would teach us to make money,” Mike said. 

“Oh, and what did he say to that?” I asked with cautious curiosity. 

“Well, he had a funny look on his face at first, and then he said he would make us an offer.” 
“Oh,” 1 said, rocking my chair back against the wall; I sat there perched on two rear legs of the 
chair. Mike did the same thing. “Do you know what the offer is?” I asked. “No, but we’ll soon 
find out.” Suddenly, Mike’s dad burst through the rickety screen door and onto the 

porch. Mike and I jumped to our feet, not out of respect but because we were startled. 

“Ready boys?” Mike’s dad asked as he pulled up a chair to sit down with us. 

We nodded our heads as we pulled our chairs away from the wall to sit in front of him. 

He was a big man, about 6 feet tall and 200 pounds. My dad was taller, about the same weight, 
and five years older than Mike’s dad. They sort of looked alike, though not of the same ethnic 
makeup. Maybe their energy was similar. 

“Mike says you want to learn to make money? Is that correct, Robert?” 

I nodded my head quickly, but with a little intimidation. He had a lot of power behind his words

and smile . 

“OK, here’s my offer. I’ll teach you, but I won’t do it classroom-style. You work for me, I’ll teach 
you. You don’t work for me, I won’t teach you. I can teach you faster if you work, and I’m 
wasting my time if you just want to sit and listen, like you do in school. That’s my offer. Take it 
or leave it.” 

“Ah... may I ask a question first?” I asked. 

“No. Take it or leave it. I’ve got too much work to do to waste my time. If you can’t make up 
you mind decisively, then you’ll never learn to make money anyway. Opportunities come and 
go. Being able to know when to make quick decisions is an important skill. You have an 
opportunity that you asked for. School is beginning or it’s over in ten seconds,” Mike’s dad said 
with a teasing smile. 

“Take it,” I said. 

“Take it,” said Mike. 

“Good,” said Mike’s dad. “Mrs. Martin will be by in ten minutes. After I’m through with her, you 
ride with her to my superette and you can begin working. I'll pay you 10 cents an hour and you 
will work for three hours every Saturday.” 

“But I have a softball game today,” I said. 

Mike’s dad lowered his voice to a stern tone. “Take it or leave it,” he 
“I’ll take it,” I replied, choosing to work and learn instead of playing softball. 

30 Cents Later 

By 9 a.m. on a beautiful Saturday morning, Mike and I were working for Mrs. Martin. She was a 
kind and patient woman. She always said that Mike and I reminded her of her two sons who 
were grown and gone. Although kind, she believed in hard work and she kept us working. She 
was a task master. We spent three hours taking canned goods off the shelves and, with a feather 
duster, brushing each can to get the dust off, and then re-stacking them neatly. It was 
excruciatingly boring work. 

Mike’s dad, whom I call my rich dad, owned nine of these little superettes with large parking 
lots. They were the early version of the 7-11 convenience stores. Little neighborhood grocery 
stores where people bought items such as milk, bread, butter and cigarettes. The problem was, 
this was Hawaii before air conditioning, and the stores could not close its doors because of the 
heat. On two sides of the store, the doors had to be wide open to the road and parking lot. 
Every time a car drove by or pulled into the parking lot, dust would swirl and settle in the store. 

Hence, we had a job for as long as there was no air conditioning. 

For three weeks, Mike and I reported to Mrs. Martin and worked our three hours. By noon, our 
work was over, and she dropped three little dimes in each of our hands. Now, even at the age 
of 9 in the mid-1950s, 30 cents was not too exciting. Comic books cost 10 cents back then, so I 
usually spent my money on comic books and went home.

By Wednesday of the fourth week, I was ready to quit. I had agreed to work only because I 
wanted to learn to make money from Mike’s dad, and now I was a slave for 10 cents an hour. 
On top of that, 1 had not seen Mike’s dad since that first Saturday. 

“I’m quitting,” I told Mike at lunchtime. The school lunch was miserable. School was boring, and 
now I did not even have my Saturdays to look forward to. But it was the 30 cents that really got 
to me. 

This time Mike smiled. 

“What are you laughing at?” I asked with anger and frustration. 

“Dad said this would happen. He said to meet with him when you were ready to quit.” 

“What?” I said indignantly. “He’s been waiting for me to get fed up?” 

“Sort of,” Mike said. “Dad’s kind of different. He teaches differently from your dad. Your mom 
and dad lecture a lot. My dad is quiet and a man of few words. You just wait till this Saturday. I’ll 
tell him you’re ready.” 

“You mean I’ve been set up?” 

“No, not really, but maybe. Dad will explain on Saturday.” 

Waiting in Line on Saturday 

I was ready to face him and I was prepared. Even my real dad was angry with him. My real dad, 
the one I call the poor one , thought that my rich dad was violating child labor laws and should be 
investigated. 

My educated poor dad told me to demand what I deserve. At least 25 cents an hour. My poor 
dad told me that if I did not get a raise, I was to quit immediately. 

“You don’t need that damned job anyway,” said my poor dad with indignity. At 8 o’clock 
Saturday morning, I was going through the same rickety door of Mike’s house. 

“Take a seat and wait in line,” Mike’s dad said as I entered. He turned and disappeared into his 
little office next to a bedroom. 

I looked around the room and did not see Mike anywhere. Feeling awkward, I cautiously sat 
down next to the same two women who where there four weeks earlier. They smiled and slid 
across the couch to make room for me . 

Forty-five minutes went by, and I was steaming. The two women had met with him and left 
thirty minutes earlier. An older gentleman was in there for twenty minutes and was also gone. 

The house was empty, and I sat out in his musty dark living room on a beautiful sunny Hawaiian 
day, waiting to talk to a cheapskate who exploited children. I could hear him rustling around the 
office, talking on the phone, and ignoring me. I was now ready to walk out, but for some reason 
I stayed. 

Finally, fifteen minutes later, at exactly 9 o’clock, rich dad walked out of his office, said nothing, 


Page 21/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


and signaled with his hand for me to enter his dingy office. 

“1 understand you want a raise or you’re going to quit,” rich dad said as he swiveled in his office 
chair. 

“Well, you’re not keeping your end of the bargain,” I blurted out nearly in tears. It was really 
frightening for a 9-year-old boy to confront a grownup. 

“You said that you would teach me if I worked for you. Well, I’ve worked for you. I’ve worked 
hard. I’ve given up my baseball games to work for you. And you don’t keep your word. You 
haven’t taught me anything. You are a crook like everyone in town thinks you are. You’re 
greedy. You want all the money and don’t take care of your employees. You make me wait and 
don’t show me any respect. I’m only a little boy, and I deserve to be treated better.” 

Rich dad rocked back in his swivel chair, hands up to his chin, somewhat staring at me. It was 
like he was studying me . 

“Not bad,” he said. “In less than a month, you sound like most of my employees.” 

“What?” I asked. Not understanding what he was saying, I continued with my grievance. “I 
thought you were going to keep your end of the bargain and teach me. Instead you want to 
torture me? That’s cruel. That’s really cruel.” 

“I am teaching you,” rich dad said quietly. 

“What have you taught me? Nothing!” I said angrily. "You haven’t even talked to me once since 
I agreed to work for peanuts. Ten cents an hour. Hah! I should notify the government about 
you. 

We have child labor laws, you know. My dad works for the government, you know." 

“Wow!” said rich dad. “Now you sound just like most of the people who used to work for me. 
People I’ve either fired or they’ve quit.” 

“So what do you have to say?” I demanded, feeling pretty brave for a little kid. “You lied to me. 
I’ve worked for you, and you have not kept your word. You haven’t taught me anything.” 

“How do you know that I’ve not taught you anything?” asked rich dad calmly. 

“Well, you’ve never talked to me. I’ve worked for three weeks, and you have not taught me 
anything,” I said with a pout. 

“Does teaching mean talking or a lecture?” rich dad asked. 

“Well, yes,” I replied. 

“That’s how they teach you in school,” he said smiling. “But that is not how life teaches you, 
and I would say that life is the best teacher of all. Most of the time, life does not talk to you. It 
just sort of pushes you around. Each push is life saying, ‘Wake up. There’s something I want you 
to learn.’ ” 

“What is this man talking about?” I asked myself silently. “Life pushing me around was life 


Page 22/114 


http : / / motsach . info

talking to me?” Now I knew I had to quit my job. I was talking to someone who needed to be 
locked up. 

“If you learn life’s lessons, you will do well. If not, life will just continue to push you around. 
People do two things. Some just let life push them around. Others get angry and push back. But 
they push back against their boss, or their job, or their husband or wife. They do not know it’s 
life that’s pushing.” 

I had no idea what he was talking about. 

“Life pushes all of us around. Some give up. Others fight. A few learn the lesson and move on. 
They welcome life pushing them around. To these few people, it means they need and want to 
learn something. They learn and move on. Most quit, and a few like you fight.” 

Rich dad stood and shut the creaky old wooden window that needed repair. "If you learn this 
lesson, you will grow into a wise, wealthy and happy young man. If you don’t, you will spend 
your life blaming a job, low pay or your boss for your problems. You’ll live life hoping for that 
big break that will solve all your money problems.” 

Rich dad looked over at me to see if I was still listening. His eyes met mine. We stared at each 
other, streams of communication going between us through our eyes. Finally, I pulled away once 
I had absorbed his last message. I knew he was right. I was blaming him, and I did ask to learn. I 
was fighting. 

Rich dad continued. “Or if you’re the kind of person who has no guts, you just give up every 
time life pushes you. If you’re that kind of person, you’ll live all your life playing it safe, doing 
the right things, saving yourself for some event that never happens. Then, you die a boring old 
man. You’ll have lots of friends who really like you because you were such a nice hard-working 
guy. You spent a life playing it safe, doing the right things. But the truth is, you let life push you 
into submission. Deep down you were terrified of taking risks. You really wanted to win, but the 
fear of losing was greater than the excitement of winning. Deep inside, you and only you will 
know you didn’t go for it. You chose to play it safe.” 

Our eyes met again. For ten seconds, we looked at each other, only pulling away once the 
message was received. 

“You’ve been pushing me around” I asked. 

“Some people might say that,” smiled rich dad. "I would say that I just gave you a taste of life.“ 
’’What taste of life?" I asked, still angry, but now curious. Even ready to learn. 

“You boys are the first people that have ever asked me to teach them how to make money. I 
have more than 150 employees, and not one of them has asked me what I know about money. 
They ask me for a job and a paycheck, but never to teach them about money. So most will 
spend the best years of their lives working for money, not really understanding what it is they 
are working for.” 

I sat there listening intently. 

“So when Mike told me about you wanting to learn how to make money, I decided to design a

course that was close to real life. I could talk until I was blue in the face, but you wouldn’t hear a 
thing. So I decided to let life push you around a bit so you could hear me. That’s why I only paid 
you 10 cents.” 

“So what is the lesson I learned from working for only 10 cents an hour?” I asked. “That you’re 
cheap and exploit your workers?” 

Rich dad rocked back and laughed heartily. Finally, after his laughing stopped, he said, “You’d 
best change your point of view. Stop blaming me, thinking I’m the problem. If you think I’m the 
problem, then you have to change me. If you realize that you’re the problem, then you can 
change yourself, learn something and grow wiser. Most people want everyone else in the world 
to change but themselves. Let me tell you, it’s easier to change yourself than everyone else.” 

“I don’t understand,” I said. 

“Don’t blame me for your problems,” rich dad said, growing impatient. 

“But you only pay me 10 cents.” 

“So what are you learning?” rich dad asked, smiling. 

“That you’re cheap,” I said with a sly grin. 

“See, you think I’m the problem,” said rich dad. 

“But you are.” 

"Well, keep that attitude and you learn nothing. Keep the attitude 
that I'm the problem and what choices do you have?" 

“Well, if you don’t pay me more or show me more respect and teach me, I’ll quit.” 

“Well put,” rich dad said. “And that’s exactly what most people do. They quit and go looking for 
another job, better opportunity, and higher pay, actually thinking that a new job or more pay will 
solve the problem. In most cases, it won’t.” 

“So what will solve the problem?” I asked. “Just take this measly 10 cents an hour and smile?” 

Rich dad smiled. “That’s what the other people do. Just accept a paycheck knowing that they 
and their family will struggle financially. But that’s all they do, waiting for a raise thinking that 
more money will solve the problem. Most just accept it, and some take a second job working 
harder, but again accepting a small paycheck.” 

I sat staring at the floor, beginning to understand the lesson rich dad was presenting. I could 
sense it was a taste of life. Finally, I looked up and repeated the question. “So what will solve 
the problem?” 

“This,” he said tapping me gently on the head. “This stuff between your ears.” 

It was at that moment that rich dad shared the pivotal point of view that separated him from his 
employees and my poor dad-and led him to eventually become one of the richest men in Hawaii

while my highly educated, but poor, dad struggled financially all his life. It was a singular point of 
view that made all the difference over a lifetime. 

Rich dad said over and over, this point of view, which I call Lesson No. 1. 

“The poor and the middle class work for money.” “The rich have money work for them.” 

On that bright Saturday morning, I was learning a completely different point of view from what I 
had been taught by my poor dad. At the age of 9, I grew aware that both dads wanted me to 
learn. Both dads encouraged me to study... but not the same things. 

My highly educated dad recommended that I do what he did. “Son, I want you to study hard, get 
good grades, so you can find a safe, secure job with a big company. And make sure it has 
excellent benefits.” My rich dad wanted me to learn how money works so I could make it work 
for me. These lessons I would learn through life with his guidance, not because of a classroom. 

My rich dad continued my first lesson, “I’m glad you got angry about working for 10 cents an 
hour. If you had not gotten angry and had gladly accepted it, I would have to tell you that I could 
not teach you. You see, true learning takes energy, passion, a burning desire. Anger is a big 
part of that formula, for passion is anger and love combined. When it comes to money, most 
people want to play it safe and feel secure. So passion does not direct them: Fear does.” 

“So is that why they’ll take a job with low par?” 1 asked. 

“Yes,” said rich dad. “Some people say I exploit people because I don’t pay as much as the 
sugar plantation or the government. I say the people exploit themselves. It’s their fear, not 
mine . ” 

“But don’t you feel you should pay them more?” I asked. 

“I don’t have to. And besides, more money will not solve the problem. Just look at your dad. He 
makes a lot of money, and he still can’t pay his bills. Most people, given more money, only get 
into more debt.” 

“So that’s why the 10 cents an hour,” I said, smiling. “It’s a part of the lesson.” 

“That’s right,” smiled rich dad. “You see, your dad went to school and got an excellent 
education, so he could get a high-paying job. Which he did. But he still has money problems 
because he never learned anything about money at school. On top of that, he believes in 
working for money.” 

“And you don’t?” I asked. 

“No, not really,” said rich dad. “If you want to learn to work for money, then stay in school. 
That is a great place to learn to do that. But if you want to learn how to have money work for 
you, then I will teach you that. But only if you want to learn.” 

“Wouldn’t everyone want to learn that” I asked. 

“No,” said rich dad. “Simply because it’s easier to learn to work for money, especially if fear is 
your primary emotion when the subject of money is discussed.”

“I don’t understand,’’ I said with a frown. 

"Don’t worry about that for now. Just know that it’s fear that keeps most people working at a 
job. The fear of not paying their bills. The fear of being fired. The fear of not having enough 
money. The fear of starting over. That’s the price of studying to learn a profession or trade, and 
then working for money. Most people become a slave to money... and then get angry at their 
boss." 

“Learning to have money work for you is a completely different course of study?” I asked. 
“Absolutely,” rich dad answered, “absolutely.” 

We sat in silence on that beautiful Hawaiian Saturday morning. My friends would have just been 
starting their Little League baseball game. But far some reason, I was now thankful I had 
decided to work for 10 cents an hour. I sensed that 1 was about to learn something my friends 
would not learn in school. 

“Ready to learn?” asked rich dad. 

“Absolutely,” I said with a grin. 

“I have kept my promise. I’ve been teaching you from afar,” my rich dad said. “At 9 years old, 
you've gotten a taste of what it feels like to work for money. Just multiply your last month by 
fifty years and you will have an idea of what most people spend their life doing.” 

“I don’t understand,” I said. 

“How did you feel waiting in line to see me? Once to get hired and once to ask for more 
money?” 

“Terrible,” I said. 

“If you choose to work for money, that is what life is like for many people,” said rich dad. 

“And how did you feel when Mrs. Martin dropped three dimes in your hand for three hours’ 
work?” 

“1 felt like it wasn’t enough. It seemed like nothing. I was disappointed,” I said. 

“And that is how most employees feel when they look at their paychecks. Especially after all the 
tax and other deductions are taken out. At least you got 100 percent.” 

“You mean most workers don’t get paid everything?" I asked with amazement. 

“Heavens no!” said rich dad. “The government always takes its share first.” 

“How do they do that." I asked. 

“Taxes,” said rich dad. “You’re taxed when you earn. You're taxed when you spend. You’re 
taxed when you save. You’re taxed when you die.” 

“Why do people let the government do that to them?” 


Page 26/114

Rich Dad Poor Dad

“The rich don’t,” said rich dad with a smile. “The poor and the middle class do. I’ll bet you that I 
earn more than your dad, yet he pays more in taxes.” 

“How can that be?” I asked. As a 9-year-old boy, that made no sense to me. “Why would 
someone let the government do that to them?” 

Rich dad sat there in silence. I guess he wanted me to listen instead of jabber away at the 
mouth. 

Finally, I calmed down. I did not like what I had heard. I knew my dad complained constantly 
about paying so much in taxes, but really did nothing about it. Was that life pushing him around? 

Rich dad rocked slowly and silently in his chair, just looking at me. 

“Ready to learn?” he asked. 

I nodded my head slowly. 

“As I said, there is a lot to learn. Learning how to have money work for you is a lifetime study. 
Most people go to college for four years, and their education ends. I already know that my study 
of money will continue over my lifetime, simply because the more I find out, the more I find out 
I need to know. Most people never study the subject. They go to work, get their paycheck, 
balance their checkbooks, and that’s it. On top of that, they wonder why they have money 
problems. Then, they think that more money will solve the problem. Few realize that it’s their 
lack of financial education that is the problem.” 

“So my dad has tax problems because he doesn’t understand money?” I asked, confused. 

“Look,” said rich dad. “Taxes are just one small section on learning how to have money work 
for you. Today, I just wanted to find out if you still have the passion to learn about money. Most 
people don’t. They want to go to school, learn a profession, have fun at their work, and earn 
lots of money. One day they wake up with big money problems, and then they can’t stop 
working. That’s the price of only knowing how to work for money instead of studying how to 
have money work for you. So do you still have the passion to learn?” asked rich dad. 

I nodded my head. 

“Good,” said rich dad. “Now get back to work. This time, 1 will pay you nothing.” 

“What?” I asked in amazement. 

"You heard me. Nothing. You will work the same three hours every 

Saturday, but this time you will not be paid 10 cents per hour. You said you wanted to learn to 
not work for money, so I’m not going to pay you anything." 

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. 

“I’ve already had this conversation with Mike. He’s already working, dusting and stacking canned 
goods for free. You’d better hurry and get back there.” 

“That’s not fair,” I shouted. “You've got to pay something.”

“You said you wanted to learn. If you don’t learn this now, you’ll grow up to be like the two 
women and the older man sitting in my living room, working for money and hoping I don’t fire 
them. Or like your dad, earning lots of money only to be in debt up to his eyeballs, hoping more 
money will solve the problem. If that’s what you want, I’ll go back to our original deal of 10 
cents an hour. Or you can do what most people grow up to do. Complain that there is not 
enough pay, quit and go looking for another job.” 

“But what do 1 do?” I asked. 

Rich dad tapped me on the head. “Use this,” he said. “If you use it well, you will soon thank me 
for giving you an opportunity, and you will grow into a rich man.” 

I stood there still not believing what a raw deal I had been handed. Here I came to ask for a 
raise, and now I was being told to keep working for nothing. 

Rich dad tapped me on the head again and said, “Use this. Now get out of here and get back to 
work.” 

LESSON #1: The Rich Don’t Work For Money 

I didn’t tell my poor dad I wasn’t being paid. He would not have understood, and I did not want 
to try to explain something that I did not yet understand myself. 

For three more weeks, Mike and I worked for three hours, every Saturday, for nothing. The 
work didn’t bother me, and the routine got easier. It was the missed baseball games and not 
being able to afford to buy a few comic books that got to me. 

Rich dad stopped by at noon on the third week. We heard his truck pull up in the parking lot 
and sputter when the engine was turned off. He entered the store and greeted Mrs. Martin with 
a hug. After finding out how things were going in the store, he reached into the ice-cream 
freezer, pulled out two bars, paid for them, and signalled to Mike and me. 

“Let’s go for a walk boys.” 

We crossed the street, dodging a few cars, and walked across a large grassy field, where a few 
adults were playing softball. Sitting down at a remote picnic table, he handed Mike and me the 
ice-cream bars. 

“How’s it going boys?” 

“OK,” Mike said. 

I nodded in agreement. 

“Learn anything yet?” rich dad asked. 

Mike and I looked at each other, shrugged our shoulders and shook our heads in unison. 
Avoiding One of Life’s Biggest Traps 

“Well, you boys had better start thinking. You’re staring at one of life’s biggest lessons. If you 
learn the lesson, you'll enjoy a life of great freedom and security. If you don’t learn the lesson, 


Page 28/114

Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


you’ll wind up like Mrs. Martin and most of the people playing softball in this park. They work 
very hard, for little money, clinging to the illusion of job security, looking forward to a three- 
week vacation each year and a skimpy pension after forty-five years of work. If that excites you, 
I'll give you a raise to 25 cents an hour.” 

“But these are good hard-working people. Are you making fun of them?” I demanded. 

A smile came over rich dad’s face. 

“Mrs. Martin is like a mother to me. I would never be that cruel. I may sound cruel because I’m 
doing my best to point something out to the two of you. I want to expand your point of view so 
you can see something. Something most people never have the benefit of seeing because their 
vision is too narrow. Most people never see the trap they are in.” 

Mike and I sat there uncertain of his message. He sounded cruel, yet we could sense he was 
desperately wanting us to know something. 

With a smile, rich dad said, “Doesn’t that 25 cents an hour sound good? Doesn’t it make your 
heart beat a little faster.” 

I shook my head “no,” but it really did. Twenty five cents an hour would be big bucks to me. 

“OK, I'll pay you a dollar an hour,” rich dad said, with a sly grin. 

Now my heart was beginning to race. My brain was screaming, 

An 

“Take it. Take it.” I could not believe what I was hearing. Still, I said nothing. 

“OK, $2 an hour.” 

My little 9-year-old brain and heart nearly exploded. After all, it was 1956 and being paid $2 an 
hour would have made me the richest kid in the world. I couldn’t imagine earning that kind of 
money. I wanted to say “yes.” I wanted the deal. I could see a new bicycle, new baseball glove, 
and adoration of my friends when I flashed some cash. On top of that, Jimmy and his rich 
friends could never call me poor again. But somehow my mouth stayed silent. 

Maybe my brain had overheated and blown a fuse. But deep down, I badly wanted that $2 an 
hour. 

The ice cream had melted and was running down my hand. The ice-cream stick was empty, and 
under it was a sticky mess of vanilla and chocolate that ants were enjoying. Rich dad was looking 
at two boys staring back at him, eyes wide open and brains empty. He knew he was testing us, 
and he knew there was a part of our emotions that wanted to take the deal. He knew that each 
human being has a weak and needy part of their soul that can be bought. And he knew that 
each human being also had a part of their soul that was strong and filled with a resolve that 
could never be bought. It was only a question of which one was stronger. He had tested 
thousands of souls in his life. He tested souls every time he interviewed someone for a job. 

“OK, $5 an hour.”

Suddenly there was a silence from inside me. Something had changed. The offer was too big 
and had gotten ridiculous. Not too many grownups in 1956 made more than $5 an hour. The 
temptation disappeared, and a calm set in. Slowly I turned to my left to look at Mike. He looked 
back at me. The part of my soul that was weak and needy was silenced. The part of me that had 
no price took over. There was a calm and a certainty about money that entered my brain and 
my soul. I knew Mike had gotten to that point also. 

“Good,” rich dad said softly. “Most people have a price. And they have a price because of 
human emotions named fear and greed. First, the fear of being without money motivates us to 
work hard, and then once we get that paycheck, greed or desire starts us thinking about all the 
wonderful things money can buy. The pattern is then set.” 

“What pattern?” I asked. 

“The pattern of get up, go to work, pay bills, get up, go to work, pay bills... Their lives are then 
run forever by two emotions, fear and greed. Offer them more money, and they continue the 
cycle by also increasing their spending. This is what I call the Rat Race.” 

“There is another way?” Mike asked. 

“Yes,” said rich dad slowly. “But only a few people find it.” 

“And what is that way?” Mike asked. 

“That’s what I hope you boys will find out as you work and study with me. That is why I took 
away all forms of pay.” 

“Any hints?” Mike asked. “We’re kind of tired of working hard, especially for nothing.” 

“Well, the first step is telling the truth,” said rich dad. 

“We haven’t been lying.” I said. 

“1 did not say you were lying. I said to tell the truth,” rich dad came 
back. 

“The truth about what?” I asked. 

“How you’re feeling,” rich dad said. “You don’t have to say it to anyone else. Just yourself.” 

“You mean the people in this park, the people who work for you, Mrs. Martin, they don’t do 
that?” I asked. 

“I doubt it,” said rich dad. “Instead, they feel the fear of not having money. Instead of 
confronting the fear, they react instead of think. They react emotionally instead of using their 
heads,” rich dad said, tapping us on our heads. “’Then, they get a few bucks in their hands, and 
again the emotion of joy and desire and greed take over, and again they react, instead of think.” 

“So their emotions do their thinking,” Mike said. 

“That’s correct,” said rich dad. "Instead of telling the truth about how they feel, they react to

Rich Dad Poor Dad

their feeling, fail to think. They feel the fear, they go to work, hoping that money will soothe 
the fear, but it doesn’t. That old fear haunts them, and they go back to work, hoping again that 
money will calm their fears, and again it doesn’t. Fear has them in this trap of working, earning 
money, working, earning money, hoping the fear will go away. But every day they get up, and 
that old fear wakes up with them. For millions of people, that old fear keeps them awake all 
night, causing a night of turmoil and worry. So they get up and go to work, hoping that a 
paycheck will kill that fear gnawing at their soul. Money is running their lives, and they refuse to 
tell the truth about that. 

Money is in control of their emotions and hence their souls." 

Rich dad sat quietly, letting his words sink in. Mike and I heard what he said, but really did not 
understand fully what he was talking about. I just knew that I often wondered why grownups 
hurried off to work. It did not seem like much fun, and they never looked that happy, but 
something kept them hurrying off to work. 

Realizing we had absorbed as much as possible of what he was talking about, rich dad said, “I 
want you boys to avoid that trap. That is really what I want to teach you. Not just to be rich, 
because being rich does not solve the problem.” 

“It doesn’t?” I asked, surprised. 

“No, it doesn’t. Let me finish the other emotion, which is desire. Some call it greed, but I prefer 
desire. It is perfectly normal to desire something better, prettier, more fun or exciting. So 
people also work for money because of desire. They desire money for the joy they think it can 
buy. But the joy that money brings is often short lived, and they soon need more money for 
more joy, more pleasure, more comfort, more security. So they keep working, thinking money 
will soothe their souls that is troubled by fear and desire. But money cannot do that.” 

“Even rich people?” Mike asked. 

“Rich people included,” said rich dad. “In fact, the reason many rich people are rich is not 
because of desire but because of fear. They actually think that money can eliminate that fear of 
not having money, of being poor, so they amass tons of it only tofind out the fear gets worse. 
They now fear losing it. I have friends who keep working even though they have plenty. I know 
people who have millions who are more afraid now than when they were poor. They’re terrified 
of losing all their money. The fears that drove them to get rich got worse. That weak and needy 
part of their soul is actually screaming louder. They don’t want to lose the big houses, the cars, 
the high life that money has bought them. They worry about what their friends would say if they 
lost all their money. Many are emotionally desperate and neurotic, although they look rich and 
have more money.” 

“So is a poor man happier?” I asked. 

“No, I don’t think so,” replied rich dad. “The avoidance of money is just as psychotic as being 
attached to money.” 

As if on cue, the town derelict went past our table, stopping by the large rubbish can and 
rummaging around in it. The three of us watched him with great interest, when before we 


Page 31/114

probably would have just ignored him. 

Rich dad pulled a dollar out of his wallet and gestured to the older man. Seeing the money, the 
derelict came over immediately, took the bill, thanked rich dad profusely and hurried off ecstatic 
with his good fortune. 

“He’s not much different from most of my employees,” said rich dad. “I’ve met so many people 
who say, ‘Oh, I’m not interested in money.’ Yet they’ll work at a job for eight hours a day. 
That’s a denial of truth. If they weren’t interested in money, then why are they working? That 
kind of thinking is probably more psychotic than a person who hoards money.” 

As I sat there listening to my rich dad, my mind was flashing back to the countless times my own 
dad said, “I’m not interested in money.” He said those words often. He also covered himself by 
always saying, "I work because I love my job.” 

“So what do we do?” I asked. “Not work for money until all traces of fear and greed are gone?” 

“No, that would be a waste of time,” said rich dad. “Emotions are what make us human. Make 
us real. The word ‘emotion’ stands for energy in motion. Be truthful about your emotions, and 
use your mind and emotions in your favor, not against yourself.” 

“Whoa!” said Mike. 

“Don’t worry about what I just said. It will make more sense in years to come, just be an 
observer, not a reactor, to your emotions. Most people do not know that it’s their emotions that 
are doing the thinking. Your emotions are your emotions, but you have got to learn to do your 
own thinking.” 

“Can you give me an example?” I asked. 

“Sure,” replied rich dad. “When a person says, ‘I need to find a job,’ it’s most likely an emotion 
doing the thinking. Fear of not having money generates that thought.” 

“But people do need money if they have bills to pay,” I said. 

“Sure they do,” smiled rich dad. “All I’m saying is that it’s fear that is all too often doing the 
thinking.” “I don’t understand,” said Mike. “For example,” said rich dad. "If the fear of not 
having enough money 

arises, instead of immediately running out to get a job so they can earn a few bucks to kill the 
fear, they instead might ask themselves this question. ‘Will a job be the best solution to this fear 
over the long run?’ In my opinion, the answer is ‘no.’ Especially when you look over a person’s 
lifetime. A job is really a short-term solution to a long-term problem." 

"But my dad is always saying, ‘Stay in school, get good grades, so you can find a safe, secure 
job.’ I spoke out, somewhat confused. 

“Yes, I understand he says that,” said rich dad, smiling. “Most people recommend that, and it’s 
a good idea for most people. But people make that recommendation primarily out of fear.” 

“You mean my dad says that because he’s afraid?” 


Page 32/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


“Yes,” said rich dad. “He’s terrified that you won’t be able to earn money and won’t fit into 
society. Don’t get me wrong. He loves you and wants the best for you. And I think his fear is 
justified. An education and a job are important. But it won’t handle the fear. You see, that same 
fear that makes him get up in the morning to earn a few bucks is the fear that is causing him to 
be so fanatical about you going to school.” 

“So what do you recommend?” I asked. 

“I want to teach you to master the power of money. Not be afraid of it. And they don’t teach 
that in school. If you don’t learn it, you become a slave to money.” 

It was finally making sense. He did want us to widen our views. To . see what Mrs. Martin could 
not see, his employees could not see, or my dad for that matter. He used examples that 
sounded cruel at the time, but I’ve never forgotten them. My vision widened that day, and I 
could begin to see the trap that lay ahead for most people. 

“You see, we’re all employees ultimately. We just work at different levels,” said rich dad. “I just 
want you boys to have a chance to avoid the trap. The trap caused by those two emotions, fear 
and desire. Use them in your favor, not against you. That’s what I want to teach you. I’m not 
interested in just teaching you to make a pile of money. That won’t handle the fear or desire. If 
you don’t first handle fear and desire, and you get rich, you’ll only be a high-paid slave.” 

“So how do we avoid the trap?” I asked. 

“The main cause of poverty or financial struggle is fear and ignorance, not the economy or the 
government or the rich. It’s self-inflicted fear and ignorance that keeps people trapped. So you 
boys go to school and get your college degrees. I’ll teach you how to stay out of the trap.” 

The pieces of the puzzle were appearing. My highly educated dad had a great education and a 
great career. But school never told him how to handle money or his fears. It became clear that I 
could learn different and important things from two fathers. 

“So you’ve been talking about the fear of not having money. How does the desire of money 
affect our thinking?” Mike asked. 

“How did you feel when I tempted you with a pay raise? Did you notice your desires rising?” 

We nodded our heads. 

“By not giving in to your emotions, you were able to delay your reactions and think. That is 
most important. We will always have emotions of fear and greed. From here on in, it is most 
important for you to use those emotions to your advantage and for the long term, and not 
simply let your emotions run you by controlling your thinking. Most people use fear and greed 
against themselves. That’s the start of ignorance. Most people live their lives chasing paychecks, 
pay raises and job security because of the emotions of desire and fear, not really questioning 
where those emotion-driven thoughts are leading them. It’s just like the picture of a donkey, 
dragging a cart, with its owner dangling a carrot just in front of the donkey’s nose. The donkey’s 
owner may be going where he wants to go, but the donkey is chasing an illusion. Tomorrow 
there will only be another carrot for the donkey.”

“You mean the moment I began to picture a new baseball glove, candy and toys, that’s like a 
carrot to a donkey?” Mike asked. 

“Yeah. And as you get older, your toys get more expensive. A new car, a boat and a big house 
to impress your friends,” said rich dad with a smile. “Fear pushes you out the door, and desire 
calls to you. Enticing you toward the rocks. That’s the trap.” 

“So what’s the answer,” Mike asked. 

“What intensifies fear and desire is ignorance. That is why rich people with lots of money often 
have more fear the richer they get. Money is the carrot, the illusion. If the donkey could see the 
whole picture, it might rethink its choice to chase the carrot.” 

Rich dad went on to explain that a human’s life is a struggle between ignorance and 
illumination. 

He explained that once a person stops searching for information and knowledge of one’s self, 
ignorance sets in. That struggle is a moment-to-moment decision-to learn to open or close one’s 
mind. 

“Look, school is very, very important. You go to school to learn a skill or profession so as to be 
a contributing member of society. Every culture needs teachers, doctors, mechanics, artists, 
cooks, business people, police officers, firefighters, soldiers. Schools train them so our culture 
can thrive and flourish,” said rich dad. “Unfortunately, for many people, school is the end, not 
the beginning.” 

There was a long silence. Rich dad was smiling. I did not comprehend everything he said that 
day. But as with most great teachers, whose words continue to teach for years, often long after 
they’re gone, his words are still with me today. 

“I’ve been a little cruel today,” said rich dad. "Cruel for a reason. I want you to always remember 
this talk. I want you to always think of Mrs. Martin. 

I want you always to think of the donkey. Never forget, because your two emotions, fear and 
desire, can lead you into life’s biggest trap, if you’re not aware of them controlling your thinking. 
To spend your life living in fear, never exploring your dreams, is cruel. To work hard for money, 
thinking that money will buy you things that will make you happy is also cruel. To wake up in 
the middle of the night terrified about paying bills is a horrible way to live. To live a life dictated 
by the size of a paycheck is not really a life. Thinking that a job will make you feel secure is lying 
to yourself. That’s cruel, and that’s the trap I want you to avoid, if possible. I’ve seen how 
money runs people’s lives. Don’t let that happen to you. Please don’t let money run your life." 

A softball rolled under our table. Rich dad picked it up and threw it back. 

“So what does ignorance have to do with greed and fear?” I asked. 

“Because it is ignorance about money that causes so much greed and so much fear,” said rich 
dad. "Let me give you some examples. A doctor, wanting more money to better provide for his 
family, raises his fees. By raising his fees, it makes health care more expensive for everyone. 
Now, it hurts the poor people the most, so poor people have worse health than those with

money. 

"Because the doctors raise their rates, the attorneys raise their rates. Because the attorneys’ 
rates have gone up, school teachers want a raise, which raises our taxes, and on and on and on. 
Soon, there will be such a horrifying gap between the rich and the poor that chaos will break 
out and another great civilization will collapse. Great civilizations collapsed when the gap 
between the haves and havenots was too great. America is on the same course, proving once 
again that history repeats itself, because we do not learn from history. We only memorize 
historical dates and names, not the lesson. 

“Aren’t prices supposed to go up?” I asked. 

“Not in an educated society with a well-run government. Prices should actually come down. Of 
course, that is often only true in theory. Prices go up because of greed and fear caused by 
ignorance. If schools taught people about money, there would be more money and lower prices, 
but schools focus only on teaching people to work for money, not how to harness money’s 
power.” 

“But don’t we have business schools?” Mike asked. “Aren’t you encouraging me to go to 
business school for my master’s degree?” 

“Yes,” said rich dad. “But all too often, business schools train employees who are sophisticated 
bean counters. Heaven forbid a bean counter takes over a business. All they do is look at the 
numbers, fire people and kill the business. I know because I hire bean counters. All they think 
about is cutting costs and raising prices, which cause more problems. Bean counting is 
important. I wish more people knew it, but it, too, is not the whole picture,” added rich dad 
angrily. 

“So is there an answer?” asked Mike. 

“Yes,” said rich dad. “Learn to use your emotions to think, not think with your emotions. When 
you boys mastered your emotions, first by agreeing to work for free, I knew there was hope. 
When you again resisted your emotions when I tempted you with more money, you were again 
learning to think in spite of being emotionally charged. That’s the first step.” 

“Why is that step so important” I asked. 

“Well, that’s up to you to find out. If you want to learn, I’ll take you boys into the briar patch. 
That place where almost everyone else avoids. I’ll take you to that place where most people are 
afraid to go. If you go with me, you'll let go of the idea of working for money and instead learn 
to have money work for you. " 

“And what will we get if we go with you. What if we agree to learn from you? What will we 
get?” I asked. “The same thing Briar Rabbit got,” said rich dad. “Freedom from the Tar Baby.” 

“Is there a briar patch?” I asked. 

“Yes,” said rich dad. “The briar patch is our fear and our greed. Going into our fear and 
confronting our greed, our weaknesses, our neediness is the way out. And the way out is 
through the mind, by choosing our thoughts.” 


Page 35/114

“Choosing our thoughts?” Mike asked, puzzled. 

“Yes. Choosing what we think rather than reacting to our emotions. Instead of just getting up 
and going to work to solve your problems, just because the fear of not having the money to pay 
your bills is scaring you. Thinking would be taking the time to ask yourself a question. A question 
like, ‘Is working harder at this the best solution to this problem?’ Most people are so terrified at 
not telling themselves the truth-that fear is in control-that they cannot think, and instead run out 
the door. Tar baby is in control. That’s what I mean by choosing your thoughts.” 

“And how do we do that?” Mike asked. 

"That’s what I will be teaching you. I’ll be teaching you to have a choice of thoughts to consider, 
rather than knee-jerk reacting, like gulping down your morning coffee and running out the door. 

“Remember what I said before: A job is only a short-term solution to a long-term problem. Most 
people have only one problem in mind, and it’s short term. It’s the bills at the end of the month, 
the Tar Baby. Money now runs their lives. Or should I say the fear and ignorance about money. 
So they do as their parents did, get up every day and go work for money. Not having the time 
to say, ‘Is there another way?’ Their emotions now control their thinking, not their heads.” 

“Can you tell the difference between emotions thinking and the head thinking?” Mike asked. 

“Oh, yes. I hear it all the time,” said rich dad. “I hear things like, ‘Well, everyone has to work.’ 
Or The rich are crooks.’ Or ‘I’ll get another job. I deserve this raise. You can’t push me 
around.’ Or ‘I like this job because it’s secure.’ Instead of, ‘Is there something I’m missing here?’ 
which breaks the emotional thought, and gives you time to think clearly.” 

I must admit, it was a great lesson to be getting. To know when someone was speaking out of 
emotions or out of clear thought. It was a lesson that served me well for life. Especially when I 
was the one speaking out of reaction and not from clear thought. 

As we headed back to the store, rich dad explained that the rich really did “make money.” They 
did not work for it. He went on to explain that when Mike and I were casting 5-cent pieces out 
of lead, thinking we were making money, we were very close to thinking the way the rich think. 
The problem was that it was illegal for us to do it. It was legal for the government and banks to 
do it, but not us. He explained that there are legal ways to make money and illegal ways. 

Rich dad went on to explain that the rich know that money is an illusion, truly like the carrot for 
the donkey. It’s only out of fear and greed that the illusion of money is held together by billions 
of people thinking that money is real. Money is really made up. It was only because of the 
illusion of confidence and the ignorance of the masses that the house of cards stood standing. 
“In fact,” he said, “in many ways the donkey’s carrot was more valuable than money.” 

He talked about the gold standard that America was on, and that each dollar bill was actually a 
silver certificate. What concerned him was the rumor that we would someday go off the gold 
standard and our dollars would no longer be silver certificates. 

“When that happens, boys, all hell is going to break loose. The poor, the middle class and the 
ignorant will have their lives ruined simply because they will continue to believe that money is 


Page 36/114

real and that the company they work for, or the government, will look after them.” 

We really did not understand what he was saying that day, but over the years it made more and 
more sense. 

Seeing What Others Miss 

As he climbed into his pickup truck, outside of his little convenience store, he said, “Keep 
working boys, but the sooner you forget about needing a paycheck, the easier your adult life will 
be. Keep using your brain, work for free, and soon your mind will show you ways of making 
money far beyond what I could ever pay you. You will see things that other people never see. 
Opportunities right in front of their noses. Most people never see these opportunities because 
they’re looking for money and security, so that’s all they get. The moment you see one 
opportunity, you will see them for the rest of your life. The moment you do that, I’ll teach you 
something else. Learn this, and you’ll avoid one of life’s biggest traps. You'll never, ever, touch 
that Tar Baby.” 

Mike and I picked up our things from the store and waved goodbye to Mrs. Martin. We went 
back to the park, to the same picnic bench, and spent several more hours thinking and talking. 

We spent the next week at school, thinking and talking. For two more weeks, we kept thinking, 
talking, and working for free. 

At the end of the second Saturday, I was again saying goodbye to Mrs. Martin and looking at the 
comic-book stand with a longing gaze. The hard thing about not even getting 30 cents every 
Saturday was that I didn’t have any money to buy comic books. Suddenly, as Mrs. Martin was 
saying goodbye to Mike and me, I saw something she was doing that I had never seen her do 
before. I mean, I had seen her do it, but I never took notice of it. 

Mrs. Martin was cutting the front page of the comic book in half. She was keeping the top half 
of the comic book cover and throwing the rest of the comic book into a large brown cardboard 
box. When I asked her what she did with the comic books, she said, “I throw them away. I give 
the top half of the cover back to the comic-book distributor for credit when he brings in the new 
comics. He’s coming in an hour.” 

Mike and I waited for an hour. Soon the distributor arrived and I asked him if we could have the 
comic books. To which he replied, “You can have them if you work for this store and do not 
resell them.” 

Our partnership was revived. Mike’s mom had a spare room in the basement that no one used. 
We cleaned it out, and began piling hundreds of comic books in that room. Soon our comic- 
book library was open to the public. We hired Mike’s younger sister, who loved to study, to be 
head librarian. She charged each child 10 cents admission to the library, which was open from 
2:30 to 4:30 p.m. every day after school. The customers, the children of the neighborhood, 
could read as many comics as they could in two hours. It was a bargain for them since a comic 
costs 10 cents each, and they could read five or six in two hours. 

Mike’s sister would check the kids as they left, to make sure they weren’t borrowing any comic 
books. She also kept the books, logging in how many kids showed up each day, who they were, 


Page 37/114

Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


and any comments they might have. Mike and I averaged $9.50 per week over a three month 
period. We paid his sister $1 a week and allowed her to read the comics for free, which she 
rarely did since she was always studying. 

Mike and F kept our agreement by working in the store every Saturday and collecting all the 
comic books from the different stores. We kept our agreement to the distributor by not selling 
any comic books. We burned them once they got too tattered. We tried opening a branch 
office, but we could never quite find someone as dedicated as Mike’s sister we could trust. 

At an early age, we found out how hard it was to find good staff. 

Three months after the library first opened, a fight broke out in the room. Some bullies from 
another neighborhood pushed their way in and started it. Mike’s dad suggested we shut down 
the business. So our comic-book business shut down, and we stopped working on Saturdays at 
the convenience store. Anyway, rich dad was excited because he had new things he wanted to 
teach us. He was happy because we had learned our first lesson so well. We had learned to 
have money work for us. By not getting paid for our work at the store, we were forced to use 
our imaginations to identify an opportunity to make money. By starting our own business, the 
comic-book library, we were in control of our own finances, not dependent on an employer. 
The best part was that our business generated money for us, even when we weren’t physically 
there. Our money worked for us. Instead of paying us money, rich dad had given us so much 
more.

CHAPTER THREE 


Lesson Two:Why Teach Financial Literacy? 

In 1990, my best friend, Mike, took over his father’s empire and is, in fact, doing a better job 
than his dad did. We see each other once or twice a year on the golf course. He and his wife 
are wealthier than you could imagine. Rich dad’s empire is in great hands, and Mike is now 
grooming his son to take his place, as his dad had groomed us. 

In 1994, I retired at the age of 47, and my wife, Kim, was 37. Retirement does not mean not 
working. To my wife and me, it means that barring unforeseen cataclysmic changes, we can 
work or not work, and our wealth grows automatically, staying way ahead of inflation. I guess it 
means freedom. The assets are large enough to grow by themselves. It’s like planting a tree. 
You water it for years and then one day it doesn’t need you anymore. It’s roots have gone down 
deep enough. Then, the tree provides shade for your enjoyment. 

Mike chose to run the empire and I chose to retire. 

Whenever I speak to groups of people, they often ask what I would recommend or what could 
they do? “How do they get started?” “Is there a good book I would recommend?” “What should 
they do to prepare their children?” “What is the secret to success?” “How do I make millions?” I 
am always reminded of this article I was once given. It goes as follows. 

THE RICHEST BUSINESSMEN 

In 1923 a group of our greatest leaders and richest businessmen held a meeting at the 
Edgewater Beach hotel in Chicago. Among them were Charles Schwab, head of the largest 
independent steel company; Samuel Instill, president of the world’s largest utility; Howard 
Hopson, head of the largest gas company; Ivar Kreuger president of the International Match 
Co., one of the world’s largest companies at that time; Leon Frazier, president of the Bank of 
International Settlements; Richard Whitney, president of the New York Stock Exchange; Arthur 
Cotton and Jesse Livermore, two of the biggest stock speculators; and Albert Fall, a member of 
President Harding’s cabinet. Twenty five years later nine of them (those listed above) ended as 
follows. Schwab died penniless after living for five years on borrowed money. Instill died broke 
living in a foreign land. Kreuger and Cotton also died broke. Hopson went insane. Whitney and 
Albert Fall were just released from prison. Fraser and Livermore committed suicide. 

I doubt if anyone can say what really happened to these men. If you look at the date, 1923, it 
was just before the 1929 market crash and the Great Depression, which I suspect had a great 
impact on these men and their lives. The point is this: Today we live in times of greater and 
faster change than these men did. I suspect there will be many booms and busts in the next 25 
years that will parallel the ups and downs these men faced. I am concerned that too many 
people are focused too much on money and not their greatest wealth, which is their education. 
If people are prepared to be flexible, keep an open mind and learn, they will grow richer and 
richer through the changes. If they think money will solve problems, I am afraid those people 
will have a rough ride. Intelligence solves problems and produces money. Money without

financial intelligence is money soon gone. 

Most people fail to realize that in life, it’s not how much money you make, it’s how much money 
you keep. We have all heard stories of lottery winners who are poor, then suddenly rich, then 
poor again. They win millions and are soon back to where they started. Or stories of 
professional athletes, who, at the age of 24, are earning millions of dollars a year, and are 
sleeping under a bridge by age 34. In the paper this morning, as I write this, there is a story of a 
young basketball player who a year ago had millions. Today, he claims his friends, attorney and 
accountant took his money, and now he works at a car wash for minimum wage. 

He is only 29. He was fired from the car wash because he refused to take off his championship 
ring as he was wiping off the cars, so his story made the newspaper. He is appealing his 
termination, claiming hardship and discrimination and that the ring is all he has left. He claims 
that if you take that away, he’ll crumble. 

In 1997, I know so many people who are becoming instant millionaires. It’s the Roaring ’20s 
one more time. And while I am glad people have been getting richer and richer, I only caution 
that in the long run, it’s not how much you make, it’s how much you keep, and how many 
generations you keep it. 

So when people ask, “Where do I get started?” or “Tell me how to get rich quick,” they often 
are greatly disappointed with my answer. I simply say to them what my rich dad said back to me 
when I was a little kid. “If you want to be rich, you need to be financially literate.” 

That idea was drummed into my head every time we were together. As I said, my educated dad 
stressed the importance of reading books, while my rich dad stressed the need to master 
financial literacy. 

If you are going to build the Empire State Building, the first thing you need to do is dig a deep 
hole and pour a strong foundation. If you are going to build a home in the suburbs, all you need 
to do is pour a 6-inch slab of concrete. Most people, in their drive to get rich, are trying to build 
an Empire State Building on a 6-inch slab. 

Our school system, having been created in the Agrarian Age, still believes in homes with no 
foundation. Dirt floors are still the rage. So kids graduate from school with virtually no financial 
foundation. One day, sleepless and deep in debt in suburbia, living the American Dream, they 
decide that the answer to their financial problems is to find a way to get rich quick. 

Construction on the skyscraper begins. It goes up quickly, and soon, instead of the Empire State 
Building, we have the Leaning Tower of Suburbia. The sleepless nights return. 

As for Mike and me in our adult years, both of our choices were possible because we were 
taught to pour a strong financial foundation when we were just kids. 

Now, accounting is possibly the most boring subject in the world. It also could be the most 
confusing. But if you want to be rich, long term, it could be the most important subject. The 
question is, how do you take a boring and confusing subject and teach it to kids? The answer is, 
make it simple. Teach it first in pictures. 

My rich dad poured a strong financial foundation for Mike and me. Since we were just kids, he 


Page 40/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


created a simple way to teach us. For years he only drew pictures and used words. Mike and I 
understood the simple drawings, the jargon, the movement of money, and then in later years, 
rich dad began adding numbers. Today, Mike has gone on to master much more complex and 
sophisticated accounting analysis because he has had to. He has a billion-dollar empire to run. I 
am not as sophisticated because my empire is smaller, yet we come from the same simple 
foundation. In the following pages, I offer to you the same simple line drawings Mike’s dad 
created for us. Though simple, those drawings helped guide two little boys in building great sums 
of wealth on a solid and deep foundation. 

Rule One. You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets. If you 
want to be rich, this is all you need to know. It is Rule No. 1. It is the only rule. This may sound 
absurdly simple, but most people have no idea how profound this rule is. Most people struggle 
financially because they do not know the difference between an asset and a liability. 

“Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire liabilities, but they think they are 
assets” 

When rich dad explained this to Mike and me, we thought he was kidding. Here we were, 
nearly teenagers and waiting for the secret to getting rich, and this was his answer. It was so 
simple that we had to stop for a long time to think about it. 

“What is an asset?” asked Mike. 

“Don’t worry right now,” said rich dad. “Just let the idea sink in. If you can comprehend the 
simplicity, your life will have a plan and be financially easy. It is simple; that is why the idea is 
missed.” 

“You mean all we need to know is what an asset is, acquire them and we’ll be rich?” I asked. 
Rich dad nodded his head. “It’s that simple.” 

“If it’s that simple, how come everyone is not rich?” I asked. 

Rich dad smiled. "Because people do not know the difference between an asset and a liability." 

I remember asking, “How could adults be so silly. If it is that simple, if it is that important, why 
would everyone not want to find out?” 

It took our rich dad only a few minutes to explain what assets and liabilities were. 

As an adult, I have difficulty explaining it to other adults. Why? Because adults are smarter. In 
most cases, the simplicity of the idea escapes most adults because they have been educated 
differently. They have been educated by other educated professionals, such as bankers, 
accountants, real estate agents, financial planners, and so forth. The difficulty comes in asking 
adults to unlearn, or become children again. An intelligent adult often feels it is demeaning to 
pay attention to simplistic definitions. 

Rich dad believed in the KISS principle-“Keep It Simple Stupid”-so he kept it simple for two 
young boys, and that made the financial foundation strong. 

So what causes the confusion? Or how could something so simple be so screwed up? Why 


Page 41/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


would someone buy an asset that was really a liability. The answer is found in basic education. 

We focus on the word “literacy” and not “financial literacy.” What defines something to be an 
asset, or something to be a liability are not words. In fact, if you really want to be confused, look 
up the words “asset” and “liability” in the dictionary. I know the definition may sound good to a 
trained accountant, but for the average person it makes no sense. But we adults are often too 
proud to admit that something does not make sense. 

As young boys, rich dad said, “What defines an asset is not words but numbers. And if you 
cannot read the numbers, you cannot tell an asset from a hole in the ground.” 

“In accounting,” rich dad would say, "it’s not the numbers, but what the numbers are telling you. 
It’s just like words. It’s not the words, but the story the words are telling you. 

Many people read, but do not understand much. It’s called reading comprehension. And we all 
have different abilities when it comes to reading comprehension. For example, I recently bought 
a new VCR. It came with an instruction book that explained how to program the VCR. All I 
wanted to do was record my favorite TV show on Friday night. I nearly went crazy trying to read 
the manual. Nothing in my world is more complex than learning how to program my VCR. I 
could read the words, but I understood nothing. I get an “A” for recognizing the words. I get an 
“F” for comprehension. And so it is with financial statements for most people. 

“If you want to be rich, you’ve got to read and understand numbers.” If I heard that once, I 
heard it a thousand times from my rich dad. And I also heard, “The rich acquire assets and the 
poor and middle class acquire liabilities.” 

Here is how to tell the difference between an asset and a liability. Most accountants and 
financial professionals do net agree with the definitions, but these simple drawings were the 
start of strong financial foundations for two young boys. 

To teach pre?teen boys, rich dad kept everything simple, using as many pictures as possible, as 
few words as possible, and no numbers for years. 

“This is the Cash Flow pattern of an asset.”

The above box is an Income Statement, often called a Profit and Loss Statement. It measures 
income and expenses. Money in and money out. The bottom diagram is the Balance Sheet. It is 
called that because it is 

supposed to balance assets against liabilities. Many financial novices don’t know the relationship 
between the Income Statement and the Balance Sheet. That relationship is vital to understand. 

The primary cause of financial struggle is simply not knowing the difference between an asset 
and a liability. The cause of the confusion is found in the definition of the two words. If you want 
a lesson in confusion, simply look up the words “asset” and “liability” in the dictionary. 

Now it may make sense to trained accountants, but to the average person, it may as well be 
written in Mandarin. You read the words in the definition, but true comprehension is difficult. 

So as I said earlier, my rich dad simply told two young boys that “assets put money in your 
pocket.” Nice, simple and usable. 

“This is Cash Flow pattern of a liability.”

Now that assets and liabilities have been defined through pictures, it may be easier to 
understand my definitions in words. 

An asset is something that puts money in my pocket. 

A liability is something that takes money out of my pocket. 

This is really all you need to know. If you want to be rich, simply spend your life buying assets. If 
you want to be poor or middle class, spend your life buying liabilities. It’s not knowing the 
difference that causes most of the financial struggle in the real world. 

Illiteracy, both in words and numbers, is the foundation of financial struggle. If people are having 


Page 43/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


difficulties financially, there is something that they cannot read, either in numbers or words. 
Something is misunderstood. The rich are rich because they are more literate in different areas 
than people who struggle financially. So if you want to be rich and maintain your wealth, it’s 
important to be financially literate, in words as well as numbers. 

The arrows in the diagrams represent the flow of cash, or “cash flow.” Numbers alone really 
mean little. Just as words alone mean little. It’s the story that counts. In financial reporting, 
reading numbers is looking for the plot, the story. The story of where the cash is flowing. In 80 
percent of most families, the financial story is a story of working hard in an effort to get ahead. 
Not because they don’t make money. But because they spend their lives buying liabilities instead 
of assets. 

For instance, this is the cash flow pattern of a poor person, or a young person still at home: 

Job (provides income)-> Expenses(Taxes Food Rent Clothes Fun Transportation) 

Asset (none) 

Liability (none) 

This is the cash flow pattern of a person in the middle class: 

Job (provides income)-> Expenses(Taxes Food Mortgage Clothes Fun Transportation) 

Asset (none) 

Liability (Mortgage Consumer loans Credit Cards) 

This is the cash flow pattern of a wealthy person: 

Assets(stocks bonds notes real estate intellectual property)->income (dividends interest rental 
income royalties) 

Liabilities (none) 

All of these diagrams were obviously oversimplified. Everyone has living expenses, the need for 
food, shelter and clothing. 

The diagrams show the flow of cash through a poor, middle class or wealthy person’s life. It is 
the cash flow that tells the story. It is the story of how a person handles their money, what they 
do after they get the money in their hand. 

The reason I started with the story of the richest men in America is to illustrate the flaw in the 
thinking of so many people. The flaw is that money will solve all problems. That is why I cringe 
whenever 1 hear people ask me how to get rich quicker. Or where do they start? I often hear, 
“I’m in debt so I need lo make more money.” 

But more money will often not solve the problem; in fact, it may actually accelerate the 
problem. Money often makes obvious our tragic human flaws. Money often puts a spotlight on 
what we do not know. That is why, all too often, a person who comes into a sudden windfall of 
cash-let’s say an inheritance, a pay raise or lottery winnings-soon returns to the same financial 
mess, if not worse than the mess they were in before they received the money. Money only

accentuates the cash flow pattern running in your head. If your pattern is to spend everything 
you get, most likely an increase in cash will just result in an increase in spending. Thus, the 
saying, “A fool and his money is one big party,” 1 have said many times that we go to school to 
gain scholastic skills and professional skills, both important. We learn to make money with our 
professional skills. In the 1960s, when I was in high school, if someone did well in school 
academically, almost immediately people assumed this bright student would go on to be a 
medical doctor. Often no one asked the child if they wanted to be a doctor. It was assumed. It 
was the profession with the promise of the greatest financial reward. 

Today, doctors are facing financial challenges I would not wish on my worst enemy; insurance 
companies taking control of the business, managed health care, government intervention, and 
malpractice suits, to name a few. Today, kids want to be basketball stars, golfers like Tiger 
Woods, computer nerds, movie stare, rock stars, beauty queens, or traders on Wall Street. 
Simply because that is where the fame, money and prestige is. That is the reason it is so hard to 
motivate kids in school today. They know that professional success is no longer solely linked to 
academic success, as it once was. 

Because students leave school without financial skills, millions of educated people pursue their 
profession successfully, but later find themselves struggling financially. They work harder, but 
don’t get ahead. What is missing from their education is not how to make money, but how to 
spend money-what to do after you make it. It’s called financial aptitude-what you do with the 
money once you make it, how to keep people from taking it from you, how long you keep it, 
and how hard that money works for you. Most people cannot tell why they struggle financially 
because they don’t understand cash flow. A person can be highly educated, professionally 
successful and financially illiterate. These people often work harder than they need to because 
they learned how to work hard, but not how to have their money work for them. 

The story of bow the quest for a Financial Dream turns into a financial nightmare. The moving- 
picture show of hard-working people has a set pattern. Recently married, the happy, highly 
educated young couple move in together, in one of their cramped rented apartments. 
Immediately, they realize that they are saving money because two can live as cheaply as 

one. 

The problem is, the apartment is cramped. They decide to save money to buy their dream 
home so they can have kids. They now have two incomes, and they begin to focus on their 
careers. 

Their incomes begin to increase. 

As their incomes go up... their expenses go up as well. 

The No. 1 expense for most people is taxes. Many people think it’s income tax, but for most 
Americans their highest tax is Social Security. As an employee, it appears as if the Social 
Security tax combined with the Medicare tax rate is roughly 7.5 percent, but it’s really 15 
percent since the employer must match the Social Security amount. In essence, it is money the 
employer cannot pay you. On top of that, you still have to pay income tax on the amount 
deducted from your wages for Social Security tax, income you never receive because it went 
directly to Social Security through withholding. Then, their liabilities go up.

This is best demonstrated by going back to the young couple. As a result of their incomes going 
up, they decide to go out and buy the house of their dreams. Once in their house, they have a 
new tax, called property tax. Then, they buy a new car, new furniture and new appliances to 
match [heir new house. Ail of a sudden, they wake up and their liabilities column is full of 
mortgage debt and credit-card debt. 

They’re now trapped in the rat race. A child comes along. They work harder. The process 
repeats itself. More money and higher taxes, also called bracket creep, A credit card comes in 
the mail. They use it. It maxes out. A loan company calls and says their greatest “asset,” their 
home, has appreciated in value. The company offers a “bill consolidation” loan, because their 
credit is so good, and tells them the intelligent thing to do is clear off the high-interest consumer 
debt by paying off their credit card. And besides, interest on their home is a tax deduction. They 
go for it, and pay off those high-interest credit cards. They breathe a sigh of relief. Their credit 
cards are paid off. 

They’ve now folded their consumer debt into their home mortgage. Their payments go down 
because they extend their debt over 30 years. It is the smart thing to do. 

Their neighbor calls to invite them to go shopping-the Memorial Day sale is on. A chance to 
save some money. They say to themselves, “I won’t buy anything. I’ll just go look.” But just in 
case they find something, they tuck that clean credit card inside their wallet. 

I run into this young couple all the time. Their names change, but their financial dilemma is the 
same. They come to one of my talks to hear what I have to say. They ask me, “Can you tell us 
how to make more money?” Their spending habits have caused them to seek more income. 

They don’t even know that the trouble is really how they choose to spend the money they do 
have, and that is the real cause of their financial struggle. It is caused by financial illiteracy and 
not understanding the difference between an asset and a liability. 

More money seldom solves someone’s money problems. Intelligence solves problems, There is 
a saying a friend of mine says over and over to people in debt. 

“If you find you have dug yourself into a hole... stop digging.” 

As a child, my dad often told us that the Japanese were aware of three powers; “The power of 
the sword, the jewel and the mirror.” 

The sword symbolizes the power of weapons. America has spent trillions of dollars on weapons 
and, because of this, is the supreme military presence in the world. 

The jewel symbolizes the power of money. There is some degree of truth to the saying, 
“Remember the golden rule. He who has the gold makes the rules.” 

The mirror symbolizes the power of self-knowledge. This self-knowledge, according to Japanese 
legend, was the most treasured of the three. 

The poor and middle class all loo often allow the power of money to control them. By simply 
getting up and working harder, failing to ask themselves if what they do makes sense, they 


Page 46/114

Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


shoot themselves in the foot as they leave for work every morning. By not fully understanding 
nioney, the vast majority of people allow the awesome power of money to control them. The 
power of money is used against them. 

If they used the power of the mirror, they would have asked themselves, “Does this make 
sense?” All too often, instead of trusting their inner wisdom, that genius inside of them, most 
people go along with the crowd. They do things because everybody else does it. They conform 
rather than question. Often, they mindlessly repeat what they have been told. Ideas such as 
“diversify” or “your home is an asset.” “Your home is your biggest investment.” “You get a tax 
break for going into greater debt.” “Get a safe job.” “Don’t make mistakes.” “Don’t take risks.” 

It is said that the fear of public speaking is a fear greater than death for most people. According 
to psychiatrists, the fear of public speaking is caused by the fear of ostracism, the fear of 
standing out, the fear of criticism, the fear of ridicule, the fear of being an outcast. The fear of 
being different prevents most people from seeking new ways to solve their problems. 

That is why my educated dad said the Japanese valued the power of the mirror the most, for it 
is only when we as humans look into the mirror do we find truth. And the main reason that most 
people say "Play it safel’ is out of fear. That goes for anything, be it sports, relationships, 
career, money. 

It is that same fear, the fear of ostracism that causes people to conform and not question 
commonly accepted opinions or popular trends. “Your home is an asset.” “Get a bill 
consolidation loan and get out of debt.” “Work harder.” “It’s a promotion.” “Someday I’ll be a 
vice president.” “Save money.” “When ! get a raise, I’ll buy us a bigger house.” “Mutual funds 
are safe.” “Tickle Me Elmo dolls are out of stock, but I just happen to have one in back that 
another customer has not come by for yet.” 

Many great financial problems are caused by going along with the crowd and trying to keep up 
with the Joneses. Occasionally, we all need to look in the mirror and be true to our inner 
wisdom rather than our fears. 

By the time Mike and I were 16 years old, we began to have problems in school. We were not 
bad kids. We just began to separate from the crowd. We worked for Mike’s dad after school and 
on the weekends. Mike and I often spent hours after work just sitting at a table with his dad 
while he held meetings with his bankers, attorneys, accountants, brokers, investors, managers 
and employees. Here was a man who had left school at the age of 13, now directing, 
instructing, ordering and asking questions of educated people. They came at his beck and call, 
and cringed when he did not approve of them. 

Here was a man who had not gone along with the crowd. He was a man who did his own 
thinking and detested the words, “We have to do it this way because that’s the way everyone 
else does it.” He also hated the word “can’t.” If you wanted him to do something, just say, "I 
don’t think 

you can do it." 

Mike and I learned more sitting at his meetings than we did in all our years of school, college 
included. Mike’s dad was not school educated, but he was financially educated and successful as 


Page 47/114

Robert T. Kiyosaki 


a result. He use to tell us over and over again. “An intelligent person hires people who are 
more intelligent than they are.” So Mike and I had the benefit of spending hours listening to 
and, in the process, learning From 

intelligent people. 

But because of this, both Mike and I just could not go along with the standard dogma that our 
teachers preached, And that caused the problems. Whenever the teacher said, “If you don’t get 
good grades, you won’t do well in the real world,” Mike and I just raised our eyebrows. When 
we were told to follow set procedures and not deviate from the rules, we could see how this 
schooling process actually discouraged creativity. We started to understand why our rich dad told 
us that schools were designed to produce good employees instead of employers. 

Occasionally Mike or I would ask our teachers how what we studied was applicable, or we asked 
why we never studied money and how it worked. To the later question, we often got the answer 
that money was not important, that if we excelled in our education, the money would follow. 

The more we knew about the power of money, the more distant we grew from the teachers and 
our classmates. 

My highly educated dad never pressured me about my grades. I often wondered why. But we did 
begin to argue about money. By the time I was 16, I probably had a far better foundation with 
money than both my mom and dad. I could keep books, I listened to tax accountants, corporate 
attorneys, bankers, real estate brokers, investors and so forth. My dad talked to teachers. 

One day, my dad was telling me why our home was his greatest investment. A not-too-pleasant 
argument took place when I showed him why I thought a house was not a good investment. 

The following diagram illustrates the difference in perception between my rich dad and my poor 
dad when it came to their homes. One dad thought his house was an asset, and the other dad 
thought it was a liability. 

I remember when I drew a diagram for my dad showing him the direction of cash flow. I also 
showed him the ancillary expenses that went along with owning the home. A bigger home 
meant bigger expenses, and the cash flow kept going out through the expense column. 

Today, I am still challenged on the idea of a house not being an asset. And 1 know that for 
many people, it is their dream as well as their largest investment. And owning your own home is 
better than nothing. I simply offer an alternate way of looking at this popular dogma. If my wife 
and I were to buy a bigger, more flashy house we realize it would not be an asset, it would be a 

liability, since it would take money out of 

our pocket. 

So here is the argument I put forth. I really do not expect most people to agree with it because 
a nice home is an emotional thing. And when it comes to money, high emotions tend to lower 
financial intelligence. 1 know from personal experience that money has a way of making every 
decision emotional.

1. D When it comes to houses, I point out that most people work all their lives paying for a 
home they never own. In other words, most people buy a new house every so many years, each 
time incurring a new 30-year loan to pay off the previous one. 

2 . D Even though people receive a tax deduction for interest on mortgage payments, they pay 
for all their other expenses with after-tax dollars. Even after they pay off their mortgage. 

3. D Property taxes. My wife’s parents were shocked when the property taxes on their home 
went to $1,000 a month. This was after they had retired, so the increase put a strain on their 
retirement budget, and they felt forced to move. 

4 Houses do not always go up in value. In 1997, I still have friends who owe a million dollars for 
a home that will today sell for only $700,000. 

5. The greatest losses of all are those from missed opportunities. If all your money is tied up in 
your house, you may be forced to work harder because your money continues blowing out of 
the expense column, instead of adding to the asset column, the classic middle class cash flow 
pattern. If a young couple would put more money into their asset column early on, their later 
years would get easier, especially as they prepared to send their children to college. Their assets 
would have grown and would be available to help cover expenses. All too often, a house only 
serves as a vehicle for incurring a home-equity loan to pay for mounting expenses. In summary, 
the end result in making a decision to own a house that is too expensive in lieu of starting an 
investment portfolio early on impacts an individual in at least the following three ways: 

1. Loss of time, during which other assets could have grown in value. 

2. Loss of additional capital, which could have been invested instead of paying for high- 
maintenance expenses related directly to the home. 

3. Loss of education. Too often, people count their house, savings and retirement plan as all 
they have in their asset column. Because they have no money to invest, they simply do not 
invest. This costs them investment 

experience. Most never become what the investment world calls a “sophisticated investor.” And 
the best investments are usually first sold to “sophisticated investors,” who then turn around and 
sell them to the people playing it safe. I am not saying don’t buy a house. I am saying, 
understand the difference between an asset and a liability. When I want a bigger house, I first 
buy assets that will generate the cash flow to pay for the house. 

My educated dad’s personal financial statement best demonstrates the life of someone in the rat 
race. His expenses seem to always keep up with his income, never allowing him to invest in 
assets. As a result, his liabilities, such as his mortgage and credit card debts are larger than his 
assets. The following picture is worth a thousand words: 

Educated Dad’s Einancial Statement 

Income = E xpe nse 

Asset < Liability

My rich dad’s personal financial statement, on the other hand, reflects the results of a life 
dedicated to investing and minimizing liabilities: 

Rich Dad’s Financial Statement 

Income > Expense 

Asset > Liability 

A review of my rich dad’s financial statement is why the rich get richer. The asset column 
generates more than enough income to cover expenses, with the balance reinvested into the 
asset column. The asset column continues to grow and, therefore, the income it produces grows 
with it. 

The result being: The rich get richer! 

Why the Rich Get Richer 

Income -> Assets -> More Income Expenses are low, Liabilities are low 

The middle class finds itself in a constant state of financial struggle. Their primary- income is 
through wages, and as their wages increase, so do their taxes. Their expenses tend to increase 
in equal increments as their wages increase; hence the phrase “the rat race.” They treat their 
home as their primary asset, instead on investing in income-producing assets. 

Why the Middle Class Struggle 

Income goes up, Expenses go up 

Assets do not increase, Liabilities do increase 

This pattern of treating your home as an investment and the philosophy that a pay raise means 
you can buy a larger home or spend more is the foundation of today’s debt-ridden society. This 
process of increased spending throws families into greater debt and into more financial 
uncertainty, even though they may be advancing in their jobs and receiving pay raises on a 
regular basis. This is high risk living caused by weak financial education. 

The massive loss of jobs in the 1990s-the downsizing of businesses-has brought to light how 
shaky the middle class really is financially. Suddenly, company pension plans are being replaced 
by 401k plans. Social Security is obviously in trouble and cannot be looked at as a source for 
retirement. Panic has sei in for the middle class. The good thing today is that many of these 
people have recognized these issues and have begun buying mutual funds. This increase in 
investing is largely responsible for the huge rally we have seen in the stock market. Today, there 
are more and more mutual funds being created to answer the demand by the middle class. 

Mutual funds are popular because they represent safety. Average mutual fund buyers are too 
busy working to pay taxes and mortgages, save for their children’s college and pay off credit 
cards. They do not have time to study to learn how to invest, so they rely on the expertise of 
the manager of a mutual fund. Also, because the mutual fund includes many different types of 
investments, they feel their money is safer because ii is “diversified.”

Robert T. Kiyosaki 


This group of educated middle class subscribes to the “diversify” dogma put out by mutual fund 
brokers and financial planners. Play it safe. Avoid risk. 

The real tragedy is that the lack of early financial education is what creates the risk faced by 
average middle class people. The reason they have to play it safe is because their financial 
positions are tenuous at best. Their balance sheets are not balanced. They are loaded with 
liabilities, with no real assets that generate income. Typically, their only source of income is 
their paycheck. Their livelihood becomes entirely dependent on their employer. 

So when genuine “deals of a lifetime” come along, those same people cannot take advantage of 
the opportunity. They must play it safe, simply because they are working so hard, are taxed to 
the max, and are loaded with debt. 

As I said at the start of this section, the most important rule is to know the difference between 
an asset and a liability. Once you understand the difference, concentrate your efforts on only 
buying income-generating assets. That’s the best way to get started on a path to becoming rich. 
Keep doing that, and your asset column will grow. Focus on keeping liabilities and expenses 
down. This will make more money available to continue pouring into the asset column. Soon, 
the asset base will be so deep that you can afford to look at more speculative investments. 
Investments that may have returns of 100 percent to infinity. Investments that for $5,000 are 
soon turned into $1 million or more. Investments that the middle class calls “too risky.” The 
investment is not risky. It’s the lack of simple financial intelligence, beginning with financial 
literacy, that causes the individual to be “too risky,” 

If you do what the masses do, you get the following picture. 

Income = Work for Owner Expense = Work for Government Asset = (none) Liability = Work for 
Bank 

As an employee who is also a homeowner, your working efforts are generally as follows: 

l.D You work for someone else. Most people, working for a paycheck, are making the owner, 
or the shareholders richer. Your efforts and success will help provide for the owner’s success 
and retirement. 

2.0 You work for the government. The government takes its share from your paycheck before 
you even see it. By working harder, you simply increase the amount of taxes taken by the 
government - most people work from January to May just for the government. 

3.D You work for the bank. After taxes, your next largest expense is usually your mortgage and 
credit card debt. 

The problem with simply working harder is that each of these three levels takes a greater share 
of your increased efforts. You need to learn how to have your increased efforts benefit you and 
your family directly. 

Once you have decided to concentrate on minding your own business, how do you set your 
goals? For most people, they must keep their profession and rely on their wages to fund their 
acquisition of assets.

As their assets grow, how do they measure the extent of their success? When does someone 
realize that they are rich, that they have wealth? As well as having my own definitions for assets 
and liabilities, I also have my own definition for wealth. Actually 1 borrowed it from a man named 
Buckminster Fuller. Some call him a quack, and others call him a living genius. Years ago he got 
all the architects buzzing because he applied for a patent in 1961 for something called a 
geodesic dome. But in the application, Fuller also said something about wealth. It was pretty 
confusing at first, but after reading it for awhile, it began to make some sense: Wealth is a 
person’s ability to survive so many number of days forward... or if I stopped working today, how 
long could I survive? 

Unlike net worth-the difference between your assets and liabilities, which is often filled with a 
person’s expensive junk and opinions of what things are worth-this definition creates the 
possibility for developing a truly accurate measurement. I could now measure and really know 
where I was in terms of my goal to become financially independent. 

Although net worth often includes these non-cash-producing assets, like stuff you bought that 
now sits in your garage, wealth measures how much money your money is making and, 
therefore, your financial survivability. 

Wealth is the measure of the cash flow from the asset column compared with the expense 
column. 

Let’s use an example. Let’s say I have cash flow from my asset column of S"J,000 a month. 
And I have monthly expenses of 52,000. What is my wealth? 

Let’s go back to Buckminster Fuller’s definition. Using his definition, how many days forward 
can I survive? And let’s assume a 30-day month. By that definition, I have enough cash flow for 
half a month. 

When I have achieved $2,000 a month cash flow from my assets, then I will be wealthy. 

So I am not yet rich, but I am wealthy. I now have income generated from assets each month 
that fully cover my monthly expenses. If I want to increase my expenses, I first must increase my 
cash flow from assets to maintain this level of wealth. Take notice that it is at this point that I no 
longer am dependent on my wages. I have focused on and been successful in building an asset 
column that has made me financially independent. If I quit my job today, I would be able to 
cover my monthly expenses with the cash flow from my assets. 

My next goal would be to have the excess cash flow from my assets reinvested into the asset 
column. The more money that goes into my asset column, the more my asset column grows. 
The more my assets grow, the more my cash flow grows. And as long as I keep my expenses 
less than the cash flow from these assets, I will grow richer, with more and more income from 
sources other than my physical labor. 

As this reinvestment process continues, I am well on my way to being rich. The actual definition 
of rich is in the eye of the beholder. You can never be too rich. 

Just remember this simple observation: The rich buy assets. The poor only have expenses. The 
middle class buys liabilities they think are assets. So how do I start minding my own business?

CHAPTER FOUR 


Lesson Three: Mind Your Own Business 

In 1974, Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald’s, was asked to speak to the MBA class at the 
University of Texas at Austin. A dear friend of mine, Keith Cunningham, was a student in that 
MBA class. After a powerful and inspiring talk, the class adjourned and the students asked Ray if 
he would join them at their favorite hangout to have a few beers. Ray graciously accepted. 

“What business am 1 in?” Ray asked, once the group had all their beers in hand. 

“Everyone laughed,” said Keith. “Most of the MBA students thought Ray was just fooling 
around.” 

No one answered, so Ray asked the question again. “What business do you think I’m in?” 

The students laughed again, and finally one brave soul yelled out, “Ray, who in the world does 
not know that you’re in the hamburger business.” 

Ray chuckled. “That is what I thought you would say.” He paused and then quickly said, ’ladies 
and gentlemen, I’m not in the hamburger business. My business is real estate." 

Keith said that Ray spent a good amount of time explaining his viewpoint. In their business plan, 
Ray knew that the primary business focus was to sell hamburger franchises, but what he never 
lost sight of was the location of each franchise. He knew that the real estate and its location was 
the most significant factor in the success of each franchise. Basically, the person that bought the 
franchise was also paying for, buying, the land under the franchise for Ray Kroc’s organization. 

McDonald’s today is the largest single owner of real estate in the world, owning even more than 
the Catholic Church. Today, McDonald’s owns some of the most valuable intersections and 
street corners in America, as well as in other parts of the world. 

Keith said it was one of the most important lessons in his life. Today, Keith owns car washes, 
but his business is the real estate under those car washes. 

The previous chapter ended with the diagrams illustrating that most people work for everyone 
else but themselves. They work first for the owners of the company, then for the government 
through taxes, and finally for the bank that owns their mortgage. 

As a young boy, we did not have a McDonald’s nearby. Yet, my rich dad was responsible for 
teaching Mike and me the same lesson that Ray Kroc talked about at the University of Texas. It 
is secret No. 3 of the rich. 

The secret is: "Mind your own business/’ Financial struggle is often directly the result of people 
working all their life for someone else. Many people will have nothing at the end of their 
working days. 

Again, a picture is worth a thousand words. Here is a diagram of the income statement and 


Page 54/114

balance sheet that best describes Ray Kroc’s advice: 

Most people 

Your Profession -> Your Income 
The Rich 

Your Assets -> Your Income 

Our current educational system focuses on preparing today’s youth to get good jobs by 
developing scholastic skills. Their lives will revolve around their wages, or as described earlier, 
their income column. And after developing scholastic skills, they go on to higher levels of 
schooling to enhance their professional abilities. They study to become engineers, scientists, 
cooks, police officers, artists, writers and so on. These professional skills allow them to enter the 
workforce and work for money. 

There is a big difference between your profession and your business. Often I ask people, “What 
is your business?” And they will say, “Oh I’m a banker.” Then I ask them if they own the bank? 
And they usually respond. “No, I work there.” 

In that instance, they have confused their profession with their business. Their profession may 
be a banker, but they still need their own business. Ray Kroc was clear on the difference 
between his profession and his business. His profession was always the same. Me was a 
salesman. At one time he sold mixers for milkshakes, and soon thereafter he was selling 
hamburger franchises- But while his profession was selling hamburger franchises, his business 
was the accumulation of income-producing real estate. 

A problem with school is that you often become what you study. So if you study, say, cooking, 
you become a chef. If you study the law, you become an attorney, and a study of auto 
mechanics makes you a mechanic. The mistake in becoming what you study is that too many 
people forget to mind their own business. They spend their lives minding someone else’s 
business and making that person rich. 

To become financially secure, a person needs to mind their own business. Your business 
revolves around your asset column, as opposed to your income column. As stated earlier, the 
No. 1 rule is to know the difference between an asset and a liability, and to buy assets. The rich 
focus on their asset columns while everyone else focuses on their income statements. 

That is why we hear so often: “I need a raise.” “If only I had a promotion.” “I am going to go 
back to school to get more training so I can get a better job.” "I am going to work overtime.” 
“Maybe I can get a second job.” “I’m quitting in two weeks. I found a job that pays more.” 

In some circles, these are sensible ideas. Yet, if you listen to Ray Kroc, you are still not minding 
your own business. These ideas all still focus on the income column and will only help a person 
become more financially secure if the additional money is used to purchase income-generating 
assets. 

The primary reason the majority of the poor and middle class are fiscally conservative-which 
means. “I can’t afford to take risks”-is that they have no financial foundation. They have to cling

to their jobs. They have to play it safe. 

When downsizing became the “in” thing lo do, millions of workers I found out their largest so- 
called asset, their home, was eating them alive, j Their asset, called a house, still cost them 
money every month. Their car, another “asset,” was eating them alive. The golf clubs in the 
garage that cost $1,000 were not worth 51,000 anymore. Without job security, they had 
nothing to fall back on. What they thought were assets could not help them survive in a time of 
financial crisis. 

1 assume most of us have filled out a credit application for a banker to buy a house or to buy a 
car. It is always interesting to look at the "net worth’ 1 section. It is interesting because of what 
accepted banking and accounting practices allow a person to count as assets. 

One day, to get a loan, my financial position did not look too good. So I added my new golf 
clubs, my art collection, books, stereo, television, Armani suits, wristwatches, shoes and other 
personal effects to boost the number in the asset column. 

But I was turned down for the loan because I had too much investment real estate. The loan 
committee did not like that 1 made so much money off of apartment houses. They wanted to 
know why I did not have a normal job, with a salary. They did not question the Armani suits, golf 
clubs or art collection. Life is sometimes tough when you do not fit the “standard” profile. 

I cringe every time I hear someone say to me that their net worth is a million dollars or 
$100,000 dollars or whatever. One of the main reasons net worth is not accurate is simply 
because the moment you begin selling your assets, you are taxed for any gains. 

So many people have put themselves in deep financial trouble when they run short of income. 
To raise cash, they sell their assets. First, their personal assets can generally be sold for only a 
fraction of the value that is listed in their personal balance sheet. Or if there is a gain on the sale 
of the assets, they are taxed on the gain. So again, the government takes its share of the gain, 
thus reducing the amount available to help them out 

Of debt. That is why 1 say someone’s net worth is often “worth less” than they think. 

Start minding your own business. Keep your daytime job, but start buying real assets, not 
liabilities or personal effects that have no real value once you get them home. A new car loses 
nearly 25 percent of the price you pay for it the moment you drive it off the lot. It is not a true 
asset even if your banker lets you list it as one. My $400 new titanium driver was worth S150 
the moment I teed off. 

For adults, keep your expenses low, reduce your liabilities and diligently build a base of solid 
assets. For young people who have not yet left home, it is important for parents to teach them 
the difference between an asset and a liability. Get them to start building a solid asset column 
before they leave home, get married, buy a house, have kids and get stuck in a risky financial 
position, clinging to a job and buying everything on credit. I see so many young couples who get 
married and trap themselves into a lifestyle that will not let them get out of debt for most of their 
working years. 

For most people, just as the last child leaves home, the parents realize they have not adequately

prepared for retirement and they begin to scramble to put some money away. Then, their own 
parents become ill and they find themselves with new responsibilities. 

So what kind of assets am I suggesting that you or your children acquire? In my world, real 
assets fall into several different categories: 

1. Businesses that do not require my presence. I own them, but they are managed or run by 
other people. If I have to work there, it’s not a business. It becomes my job. 

2. Stocks. 

3. Bonds. 

4. Mutual funds. 

5. Income-generating real estate. 

6. Notes (lOUs). 

7. Royalties from intellectual property such as music, scripts, patents. 

8. And anything else that has value, produces income or appreciates and has a ready market. 

As a young boy, my educated dad encouraged me to find a safe job. My rich dad, on the other 
hand, encouraged me to begin acquiring assets that I loved. “If you don’t love it, you won’t take 
care of it.” I collect real estate simply because I love buildings and land. I love shopping for 
them. 1 could look at them all day long. When problems arise, the problems are not so bad that 
it changes my love for real estate. For people who hate real estate, they shouldn’t buy it. 

I love stocks of small companies, especially startups. The reason is that I am an entrepreneur, 
not a corporate person. In my early years. I worked in large organizations, such as Standard Oil 
of California, the U.S. Marine Corps, and Xerox Corp. I enjoyed my time with those 
organizations and have fond memories, but I know deep down I am not a company man. I like 
starting companies, not running them. So my slock buys are usually of small companies, and 
sometimes I even start the company and take it public. Fortunes are made in new-stock issues, 
and I love the game. Many people are afraid of small-cap companies and call them risky, and 
they are. But risk is always diminished if you love what the investment is, understand it and 
know the game. With small companies, my investment strategy is to be out of the stock in a 
year. My real estate strategy, on the other hand, is to start small and keep trading the properties 
up for bigger properties and, therefore, delaying paying taxes on the gain. This allows the value 
to increase dramatically. I generally hold real estate less than seven years. 

For years, even while I was with the Marine Corps and Xerox, I did what my rich dad 
recommended. I kept my daytime job, but I still minded my own business. I was active in my 
asset column. I traded real estate and small stocks. Rich dad always stressed the importance of 
financial literacy. The better I was at understanding the accounting and cash management, the 
better I would be at analyzing investments and eventually starting and building my own company. 

I would not encourage anyone to start a company unless they really want to. Knowing what I 
know about running a company, I would not wish that task on anyone. There are times when 


Page 57/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad

people cannot find employment, where starting a company is a solution for them. The odds are 
against success: Nine out of 10 companies fail in five years. Of those that survive the first five 
years, nine out of every 10 of those eventually fail, as well. So only if you really have the desire 
to own your own company do I recommend it. Otherwise, keep your daytime job and mind your 
own business. When I say mind your own business, 1 mean to build and keep your asset column 
strong. Once a dollar goes into it, never let it come out. Think of it this way, once a dollar goes 
into your asset column, it becomes your employee. The best thing about money is that it works 
24 hours a day and can work for generations. Keep your daytime job, be a great hard-working 
employee, but keep building that asset column. 

As your cash flow grows, you can buy some luxuries. An important distinction is that rich people 
buy luxuries last, while the poor and middle class tend to buy luxuries first. The poor and the 
middle class often buy luxury items such as big houses, diamonds, furs, jewelry or boats because 
they want to look rich. They look rich, but in reality they just get deeper in debt on credit. The 
old-money people, the long-term rich, built their asset column first. Then, the income generated 
from the asset column bought their luxuries. The poor and middle class buy luxuries with their 
own sweat, blood and children’s inheritance. 

A true luxury is a reward for investing in and developing a real asset. For example, when my 
wife and I had extra money coming from our apartment houses, she went out and bought her 
Mercedes. It did not take any extra work or risk on her part because the apartment house 
bought the car. She did, however, have to wait for it for four years while the real estate 
investment portfolio grew and finally began throwing off enough extra cash flow to pay for the 
car. But the luxury, the Mercedes, was a true reward because she had proved she knew how to 
grow her asset column. That car now means a lot more to her than simply another pretty car. It 
means she used her financial intelligence to afford it. 

What most people do is they impulsively go out and buy a new car, or some other luxury, on 
credit. They may feel bored and just want a new toy. Buying a luxury on credit often causes a 
person to sooner or later actually resent that luxury because the debt on the luxury becomes a 
financial burden. 

After you’ve taken the time and invested in and built your own business, you are now ready to 
add the magic touch-the biggest secret of the rich. The secret that puts the rich way ahead of 
the pack. The reward at the end of the road for diligently taking the time to mind your own 
business.

CHAPTER FIVE 


Lesson FounThe History of and The Power of Corporation 

I remember in school being told the story of Robin Hood and his Merry Men. My schoolteacher 
thought it was a wonderful story of a romantic hero, a Kevin Costner type, who robbed from the 
rich and gave to the poor. My rich dad did not see Robin Hood as a hero. He called Robin Hood 
a crook. 

Robin Hood may be long gone, but his followers live on. How often I still hear people say, “Why 
don’t the rich pay for it?” Or “The rich should pay more in taxes and give it to the poor.” 

It is this idea of Robin Hood, or taking from the rich to give to the poor that has caused the 
most pain for the poor and the middle class. The reason the middle class is so heavily taxed is 
because of the Robin Hood ideal. The real reality is that the rich are not taxed. It’s the middle 
class who pays for the poor, especially the educated upper-income middle class. 

Again, to understand fully how things happen, we need to look at the historical perspective. We 
need to look at the history of taxes. Although my highly educated dad was an expert on the 
history of education, my rich dad fashioned himself as an expert on the history of taxes. 

Rich dad explained to Mike and me that in England and America originally, there were no taxes. 
Occasionally there were temporary taxes levied in order to pay for wars. The king or the 
president would put the word out and ask everyone to “chip in.” Taxes were levied in Britain for 
the fight against Napoleon from 1799 to 1816, and in America taxes were levied to pay for the 
Civil War from 1861 to 1865. 

In 1874, England made income tax a permanent levy on its citizens. In 1913, an income tax 
became permanent in the United States with the adoption of the 16th Amendment to the 
Constitution. At one time, Americans were anti-tax. It had been the excessive tax on tea that led 
to the famous Tea Party in Boston Harbor, an incident that helped ignite the Revolutionary 
War. It took approximately 50 years in both England and ’ the United States to sell the idea of a 
regular income tax. ; 

What these historical dates fail to reveal is that both of these taxes were initially levied against 
only the rich. It was this point that rich dad wanted Mike and me to understand. He explained 
that the idea of taxes was made popular, and accepted by the majority, by telling the poor and 
the middle class that taxes were created only to punish the rich. This is how the masses voted 
for the law, and it became constitutionally legal. Although it was intended to punish the rich, in 
reality it wound up punishing the very people who voted for it, the poor and middle class. 

“Once government got a taste of money, the appetite grew,” said rich dad. “Your dad and I are 
exactly opposite. He’s a government bureaucrat, and I am a capitalist. We get paid, and our 
success is measured on opposite behaviors. He gets paid to spend money and hire people. The 
more he spends and the more people he hires, the larger his organization becomes. In the 
government, the larger his organization, the more he is respected. On the other hand, within

my organization, the fewer people I hire and the less money 1 spend, the more I am respected 
by my investors. That’s why I don’t like government people. They have different objectives from 
most business people. As the government grows, more and more tax dollars will be needed to 
support it.” 

My educated dad sincerely believed that government should help 

people. He loved John F. Kennedy and especially the idea of the Peace Corps. He loved the 
idea so much that both he and my mom worked for the Peace Corps training volunteers to go to 
Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. He always strived for additional grants and increases in 
his budget so he could hire more people, both in his job with the Education Department and in 
the Peace Corps. That was his job. 

From the time I was about 10 years old, I would hear from my rich dad that government workers 
were a pack of lazy thieves, and from my poor dad I would hear how the rich were greedy 
crooks who should be made to pay more taxes. Both sides have valid points. It was difficult to go 
to work for one of the biggest capitalists in town and come home to a father who was a 
prominent government leader. It was not easy knowing who to believe. 

Yet, when you study the history of taxes, an interesting perspective emerges. As I said, the 
passage of taxes was only possible because the masses believed in the Robin Hood theory of 
economics, which was to take from the rich and give to everyone else. The problem was that 
the government’s appetite for money was so great that taxes soon needed to be levied on the 
middle class, and from there it kept “trickling down.” 

The rich, on the other hand, saw an opportunity. They do not play by the same set of rules. As 
I’ve stated, the rich already knew about corporations, which became popular in the days of 
sailing ships. The rich created the corporation as a vehicle to limit their risk to the assets of each 
voyage. The rich put their money into a corporation to finance the voyage. The corporation 
would then hire a crew to sail to the New World to look for treasures. If the ship was lost, the 
crew lost their lives, but the loss to the rich would be limited only to the money they invested for 
that particular voyage. The diagram that follows shows how the corporate structure sits outside 
your personal income statement and balance sheet. 

How the Rich Play the Game 

Is reduced/diminished by expenses Assets > Income (through 

personal corporation) 

It is the knowledge of the power of the legal structure of the corporation that really gives the 
rich a vast advantage over the poor and the middle class. Having two fathers teaching me, one a 
socialist and the other a capitalist, I quickly began to realize that the philosophy of the capitalist 
made more financial sense to me. It seemed to me that the socialists ultimately penalized 
themselves, due to their lack of financial education. No matter what the “Take from the rich” 
crowd came up with, the rich always found a way to outsmart them. That is how taxes were 
eventually levied on the middle class. The rich outsmarted the intellectuals, solely because they 
understood the power of money, a subject not taught in schools. 

How did the rich outsmart the intellectuals? Once the “Take from the rich” tax was passed, cash 


Page 60/114

started flowing into government coffers. Initially, people were happy. Money was handed out to 
government workers and the rich. It went to government workers in the form of jobs and 
pensions. It went to the rich via their factories receiving government contracts. The government 
became a large pool of money, but the problem was the fiscal management of that money. 
There really is no recirculation. In other words, the government policy, if you were a 
government bureaucrat, was to avoid having excess money. If you failed to spend your allotted 
funding, you risked losing it in the next budget. 

You would certainly not be recognized for being efficient. Business people, on the other hand, 
are rewarded for having excess money and are recognized for their efficiency. 

As this cycle of growing government spending continued, the demand for money increased and 
the “Tax the rich” idea was now being adjusted to include lower-income levels, down to the very 
people who voted it in, the poor and the middle class. 

True capitalists used their financial knowledge to simply find a way to escape. They headed back 
to the protection of a corporation. A corporation protects the rich. But what many people who 
have never formed a corporation do not know is that a corporation is not really a thing. A 
corporation is merely a file folder with some legal documents in it, sitting in some attorney’s 
office registered with a state government agency. It’s not a big building with the name of the 
corporation on it. It’s not a factory or a group of people. A corporation is merely a legal 
document that creates a legal body without a soul. The wealth of the rich was once again 
protected. Once again, the use of corporations became popular-once the permanent income 
laws were passed- because the income-tax rate of the corporation was less than the individual 
income-tax rates. In addition, as described earlier, certain expenses could be paid with pre-tax 
dollars within the corporation. 

This war between the haves and have-nots has been going on for hundreds of years. It is the 
“Take from the rich” crowd versus the rich. The battle is waged whenever and wherever laws 
are made. The battle will go on forever. The problem is, the people who lose are the 
uninformed. The ones who get up every day and diligently go to work and pay taxes. If they 
only understood the way the rich play the game, they could play it too. Then, they would be on 
their way to their own financial independence. This is why I cringe every time I hear a parent 
advise their children to go to school, so they can find a safe, secure job. An employee with a 
safe, secure job, without financial aptitude, has no escape. 

Average Americans today work five to six months for the government before they make enough 
to cover their taxes. In my opinion, that is a long time. The harder you work, the more you pay 
the government. That is why I believe that the 

idea of “Take from the rich” backfired on the very people who voted it in. 

Every time people try to punish the rich, the rich don’t simply 

comply, they react. They have the money, power and intent to change things. They do not just 
sit there and voluntarily pay more taxes. They search for ways to minimize their tax burden. 
They hire smart attorneys j and accountants, and persuade politicians to change laws or create 
legal loopholes. They have the resources to effect change. 


Page 61/114

The Tax Code of the United States also allows other ways to save on taxes. Most of these 
vehicles are available to anyone, but it is the rich who usually look for them because they are 
minding their own business. For example, “1031” is jargon for Section 1031 of the Internal 
Revenue Code, which allows a seller to delay paying taxes on a piece of real estate; that is sold 
for a capital gain through an exchange for a more expensive piece of real estate. Real estate is 
one investment vehicle that allows such a great tax advantage. As long as you keep trading up in 
value, you I will not be taxed on the gains, until you liquidate. People who do not take advantage 
of these tax savings offered legally are missing a great opportunity to build their asset columns. 

The poor and middle class do not have the same resources. They sit there and let the 
government’s needles enter their arm and allow the blood donation to begin. Today, I am 
constantly shocked at the number of people who pay more taxes, or take fewer deductions, 
simply because they are afraid of the government. And I do know how frightening and 
intimidating a government tax agent can be. I have had friends who have had their businesses 
shut down and destroyed, only to find out it was a mistake on the part of the government. I 
realize all that. But the price of working from January to mid-May is a high price to pay for that 
intimidation. My poor dad never fought back. My rich dad didn’t either. He just played the game 
smarter, and he did it through corporations-the biggest secret of the rich. 

You may remember the first lesson I learned from my rich dad. I was a little boy of 9 who had to 
sit and wait for him to choose to talk to me. 1 often sat in his office waiting for him to “get to 
me.” He was ignoring me on purpose. He wanted me to recognize his power and desire to 
have that power for myself one day. For all the years I studied J and learned from him, he 
always reminded me that knowledge was power. And with money comes great power that 
requires the right knowledge to keep it and make it multiply. Without that knowledge, the world 
pushes you around. Rich dad constantly reminded Mike and me that the biggest bully was not 
the boss or the supervisor, but the tax man. The tax man will always take more if you let him. 

The first lesson of having money work for me, as opposed to working for money, is really all 
about power. If you work for money, you give the power up to your employer. If your money 
works for you, you keep and control the power. 

Once we had this knowledge of the power of money working for us, he wanted us to be 
financially smart and not let bullies push us around. You need to know the law and how the 
system works. If you’re ignorant, it is easy to be bullied. If you know what you’re talking about, 
you have a fighting chance. That is why he paid so much for smart tax accountants and 
attorneys. It was less expensive to pay them than pay the government. His best lesson to me, 
which I have used most of my life, is “Be smart and you won’t be pushed around as much.” He 
knew the law because he was a law-abiding citizen. He knew the law because it was expensive 
to not know the law. “If you know you’re right, you’re not afraid of fighting back.” Even if you 
are taking on Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men. 

My highly educated dad always encouraged me to seek a good job with a strong corporation. He 
spoke of the virtues of “working your way up the corporate ladder.” He didn’t understand that, 
by relying solely on a paycheck from a corporate employer, I would be a docile cow ready for 
milking. 

When I told my rich dad of my father’s advice, he only chuckled. “Why not own the ladder?”

was all he said. 

As a young boy, I did not understand what rich dad meant by owning my own corporation. It 
was an idea that seemed impossible, and intimidating. Although I was excited by the idea, my 
youth would not let me envision the possibility that grownups would someday work for a 
company I would own. 

The point is, if not for my rich dad, I would have probably followed my educated dad’s advice. It 
was merely the occasional reminder of my rich dad that kept the idea of owning my own 
corporation alive and kept me on a different path. By the time I was 15 or 16, 1 knew I was not 
going to continue down the path my educated dad was recommending. I did not know how I was 
going to do it, but I was determined not to head in the direction most of my classmates were 
heading. That decision changed my life. 

It was not until I was in my mid-20s that my rich dad’s advice began to make more sense. I was 
just out of the Marine Corps and working for Xerox. I was making a lot of money, but every 
time I looked at my paycheck, I was always disappointed. The deductions were so large, and the 
more I worked, the greater the deductions. As I became more successful, my bosses talked 
about promotions and raises. It was flattering, but I could hear my rich dad asking me in my ear: 
“Who are you working for? Who are you making rich?” 

In 1974, while still an employee for Xerox, I formed my first corporation and began “minding 
my own business.” There were already a few assets in my asset column, but now I was 
determined to focus on making it bigger. Those paychecks with all the deductions made all the 
years of my rich dad’s advice make total sense. I could see the future if I followed my educated 
dad’s advice. 

Many employers feel that advising their workers to mind their own business is bad for business. I 
am sure it can be for certain individuals. But for me, focusing on my own business, developing 
assets, made me a better employee. I now had a purpose. I came in early and worked diligently, 
amassing as much money as possible so I could begin investing in real estate. Hawaii was just set 
to boom, and there were 4 fortunes to be made. The more I realized we were in the beginning 
stages of a boom, the more Xerox machines I sold. The more I sold, the more money I made, 
and, of course, the more deductions there were from my paycheck. It was inspiring. I wanted 
out of the trap of being an employee so badly that I worked harder, not less. By 1978,1 was 
consistently one of the top five salespeople in sales, often No. 1. I badly wanted out of the rat 
race. 

In less than three years, I was making more in my own little corporation, which was a real estate 
holding company, than I was making at Xerox. And the money I was making in my asset 
column, in my own corporation, was money working for me. Not me pounding on doors selling 
copiers. My rich dad’s advice made much more sense. Soon the cash flow from my properties 
was so strong that my company bought me my first Porsche. My fellow Xerox salespeople 
thought I was spending my commissions. I wasn’t. I was investing my commissions in assets. 

My money was working hard to make more money. Each dollar in my asset column was a great 
employee, working hard to make more employees and buy the boss a new Porsche with before- 
tax dollars. I began to work harder for Xerox. The plan was working, and my Porsche was the

proof. 

By using the lessons I learned from my rich dad, I was able to get out of the “proverbial rat race” 
of being an employee at an early age. It was made possible because of the strong financial 
knowledge I had acquired through these lessons. Without this financial knowledge, which I call 
financial IQ, my road to financial independence would have been much more difficult. I now 
teach others through financial seminars in the hope that I may share my knowledge with them. 
Whenever 1 do my talks, I remind people that financial IQ is made up of knowledge from four 
broad areas of expertise. 

No. 1 is accounting. What I call financial literacy. A vital skill if you want to build an empire. The 
more money you are responsible for, the more accuracy is required, or the house comes 
tumbling down. This is the left brain side, or the details. Financial literacy is the ability to read 
and understand financial statements. This ability allows you to identify the strengths and 
weaknesses of any business. 

No. 2 is investing. What I call the science of money making money. This involves strategies and 
formulas. This is the right brain side, or the creative side. 

No. 3 is understanding markets. The science of supply and demand. There is a need to know 
the “technical” aspects of the market, which is emotion driven; the Tickle Me Elmo doll during 
Christmas 1996 is a case of a technical or emotion-driven market. The other market factor is 
the “fundamental” or the economic sense of an investment. Does an investment make sense or 
does it not make sense based on the current market conditions. 

Many people think the concepts of investing and understanding the market are too complex for 
kids. They fail to see that kids know those subjects intuitively. For those not familiar with the 
Elmo doll, it was a Sesame Street character that was highly touted to the kids just before 
Christmas. Most all kids wanted one, and put it at the top of their Christmas list. Many parents 
wondered if the company intentionally held the product off the market, while continuing to 
advertise it for Christmas. A panic set in due to high demand and lack of supply. Having no dolls 
to buy in the stores, scalpers saw an opportunity to make a small fortune from desperate 
parents. The unlucky parents who did not find a doll were forced to buy another toy for 
Christmas. The incredible popularity of the Tickle Me Elmo doll made no sense to me, but it 
serves as an excellent example of supply and demand economics. The same thing goes on in 
the stock, bond, real estate and baseball-card markets. 

No. 4 is the law. For instance, utilizing a corporation wrapped around the technical skills of 
accounting, investing and markets can aid explosive growth. An individual with the knowledge of 
the tax advantages and protection provided by a corporation can get rich so much faster than 
someone who is an employee or a small-business sole proprietor. It’s like the difference 
between someone walking and someone flying. The difference is profound when it comes to 
long-term wealth. 

1. Tax advantages: A corporation can do so many things that an individual cannot. Like pay for 
expenses before it pays taxes. That is a whole area of expertise that is so exciting, but not 
necessary to get into unless you have sizable assets or a business. Employees earn and get taxed 
and they try to live on what is left. A corporation earns, spends everything it can, and is taxed 


Page 64/114 


http : / / motsach . info

on anything that is left. It’s one of the biggest legal tax loopholes that the rich use. They’re easy 
to set up and are not expensive if you own investments that are producing good cash flow. For 
example; by owning your own corporation - vacations are board meetings in Hawaii. Car 
payments, insurance, repairs are company expenses. Health club membership is a company 
expense. Most restaurant meals are partial expenses. And on and on - but do it legally with pre- 
tax dollars. 

2. Protection from lawsuits. We live in a litigious society. Everybody wants a piece of your 
action. The rich hide much of their wealth using vehicles such as corporations and trusts to 
protect their assets from creditors. When someone sues a wealthy individual they are often met 
with layers of legal protection, and often find that the wealthy person actually owns nothing. 
They control everything, but own nothing. The poor and middle class try to own everything and 
lose it to the government or to fellow citizens who like to sue the rich. They learned it from the 
Robin Hood story. Take from the rich, give to the poor. 

It is not the purpose of this book to go into the specifics of owning a corporation. But I will say 
that if you own any kind of legitimate assets, I would consider finding out more about the 
benefits and protection offered by a corporation as soon as possible. There are many books 

written on the subject that will detail the benefits and even walk you through the steps necessary 
to set up a corporation. One book in particular, Inc. and Grow Rich provides a wonderful insight 
into the power of personal corporations. 

Financial IQ is actually the synergy of many skills and talents. But I would say it is the 
combination of the four technical skills listed above that make up basic financial intelligence. If 
you aspire to great wealth, it is the combination of these skills that will greatly amplify an

CHAPTER SIX 


Lesson Five:The Rich Invent Money 

Last night, I took a break from writing and watched a TV program on the history of a young 
man named Alexander Graham Bell. Bell had just patented his telephone, and was having 
growing pains because the demand for his new invention was so strong. Needing a bigger 
company, he then went to the giant at that time, Western Union, and asked them if they would 
buy his patent and his tiny company. He wanted $100,000 for the whole package. The 
president of Western Union scoffed at him and turned him down, saying the price was 
ridiculous. The rest is history. A multi-billion-dollar industry emerged, and AT&T was born. 

The evening news came on right after the story of Alexander Graham Bell ended. On the news 
was a story of another downsizing at a local company. The workers were angry and complained 
that the company ownership was unfair. A terminated manager of about 45 years of age had his 
wife and two babies at the plant and was begging the guards to let him talk to the owners to ask 
if they would reconsider his termination. He had just bought a house and was afraid of losing it. 
The camera focused in on his pleading for all the world to see. Needless to say, it held my 
attention. 

I have been teaching professionally since 1984. It has been a great experience and rewarding. It 
is also a disturbing profession, for I have 

taught thousands of individuals and I see one thing in common in all of us, myself included. We 
all have tremendous potential, and we all are blessed with gifts. Yet, the one thing that holds all 
of us back is some degree of self-doubt. It is not so much the lack of technical information that 
holds us back, but more the lack of self-confidence. Some are more affected than others. 

Once we leave school, most of us know that it is not as much a matter of college degrees or 
good grades that count. In the real world outside of academics, something more than just grades 
is required. I have heard it called “guts,” “chutzpah,” “balls,” “audacity,” “bravado,” “cunning,” 
“daring,” “tenacity” and “brilliance.” This factor, whatever it is labeled, ultimately decides one’s 
future much more than school grades. 

Inside each of us is one of these brave, brilliant and daring characters. There is also the flip side 
of that character: people who could get down on their knees and beg if necessary. After a year 
in Vietnam, as a Marine Corps pilot, I intimately got to know both of those characters-inside of 
me. One is not better than the other. 

Yet, as a teacher, I recognized that it was excessive fear and self-doubt that were the greatest 
detractors of personal genius. It broke my heart to see students know the answers, yet lack the 
courage to act on the answer. Often in the real world, it’s not the smart that get ahead but the 
bold. 

In my personal experience, your financial genius requires both technical knowledge as well as 
courage. If fear is too strong, the genius is suppressed. In my classes I strongly urge students to 


Page 66/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


learn to take risks, to be bold, to let their genius convert that fear into power and brilliance. It 
works for some and just terrifies others. I have come to realize that for most people, when it 
comes to the subject of money, they would rather play it safe. I have had to field questions such 
as: Why take risks? Why should I bother developing my financial IQ? Why should I become 
financially literate? 

And I answer, “Just to have more options.” 

There are huge changes up head. Just as I started with the story of the young inventor 
Alexander Graham Bell, in the coming years there will be more people just like him. There will 
be a hundred people like Bill Gates and hugely successful companies like Microsoft created 
every year, all over the world. And there also will be many more bankruptcies, layoffs and 
downsizing. 

So why bother developing your financial IQ? No one can answer that but you. Yet, I can tell you 
why I myself do it. I do it because it is the most exciting time to be alive. I’d rather be welcoming 
change than dreading change. I’d rather be excited about making millions than worrying about 
not getting a raise. This period we are in now is a most exciting time, unprecedented in our 
world’s history. Generations from now, people will look back at this period of time and remark 
at what an exciting era it must have been. It was the death of the old and birth of the new. It 
was full of turmoil and it was exciting. 

So why bother developing your financial IQ? Because if you do, you will prosper greatly. And if 
you don’t, this period of time will be a frightening one. It will be a time of watching people 
move boldly forward while others cling to decaying life rings. 

Land was wealth 300 years ago. So the person who owned the land owned the wealth. Then, it 
was factories and production, and America rose to dominance. The industrialist owned the 
wealth. Today, it is information. And the person who has the most timely information owns the 
wealth. The problem is, information flies all around the world at the speed of light. The new 
wealth cannot be contained by boundaries and borders as land and factories were. The changes 
will be faster and more dramatic. There will be a dramatic increase in the number of new 
multimillionaires. There also will be those who are left behind. 

Today, I find so many people struggling, often working harder, simply because they cling to old 
ideas. They want things to be the way they were; they resist change. I know people who are 
losing their jobs or their houses, and they blame technology or the economy or their boss. Sadly 
they fail to realize that they might be the problem. Old ideas are their biggest liability. It is a 
liability simply because they fail to realize that while that idea or way of doing something was an 
asset yesterday, yesterday is gone. 

One afternoon I was teaching investing using a board game I had invented, CASHFLOW, as a 
teaching tool. A friend had brought someone along to attend the class. This friend of a friend 
was recently divorced, had been badly burned in the divorce settlement, and was now searching 
for some answers. Her friend thought the class might help. 

The game was designed to help people learn how money works. In playing the game, they 
learn about the interaction of the income statement with the balance sheet. They learn how 
“cash flows” between 


Page 67/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


the two and how the road to wealth is through striving to increase your monthly cash flow from 
the asset column to the point that it exceeds your j monthly expenses. Once you accomplish 
this, you are able to get out of the “Rat Race” and out onto the “Fast Track”. 

As I have said, some people hate the game, some love it, and others miss the point. This 
woman missed a valuable opportunity to learn something. In the opening round, she drew a 
“doodad” card with the boat on it. At first she was happy. “Oh, I’ve got a boat.” Then, as her 
friend tried to explain how the numbers worked on her income statement and balance sheet, 
she got frustrated because she “had never liked math. The rest of her table waited while her 
friend continued explaining the relationship between the income statement, balance sheet and 
monthly cash flow. Suddenly, when she realized how the numbers worked, it dawned on her 
that her boat was eating her alive. Later on in the game, she was also ’’downsized" and had a 
child. It was a horrible game for her. 

After the class, her friend came by and told me that she was upset. She had come to the class to 
learn about investing and did not like the idea that it took so long to play a silly game. 

Her friend attempted to tell her to look within herself to see if the game “reflected” on herself 
in any way. With that suggestion, the woman demanded her money back. She said that the very 
idea that a game could be a reflection of her was ridiculous. Her money was promptly refunded 
and she left. 

Since 1984, I have made millions simply by doing what the school system does not. In school, 
most teachers lecture. I hated lectures as a student; I was soon bored and my mind would drift. 

In 1984,1 began teaching via games and simulations. I always encouraged adult students to look 
at games as reflecting back to what they know, and what they needed to learn. Most 
importantly, a game reflects back on one’s behavior. It’s an instant feedback system. Instead of 
the teacher lecturing you, the game is feeding back a personalized lecture, custom made just for 
you. 

The friend of the woman who left later called to give me an update. She said her friend was fine 
and had calmed down. In her cooling-off period, she could see some slight relationship between 
the game and her life. 

Although she and her husband did not own a boat, they did own 

everything else imaginable. She was angry after their divorce, both because he had run off with 
a younger woman and because after twenty years of marriage, they had accumulated little in the 
way of assets. There was virtually nothing for them to split. Their twenty years of married life 
had been incredible fun, but all they had accumulated was a ton of doodads. 

She realized that her anger at doing the numbers-the income statement and balance sheet-came 
from her embarrassment of not understanding them. She had believed that finances were the 
man’s job. She maintained the house and did the entertaining, and he handled the finances. She 
was now quite certain that in the last five years of their marriage, he had hidden money from 
her. She was angry at herself for not being more aware of where the money was going, as well 
as for not knowing about the other woman.

Just like a board game, the world is always providing us with instant feedback. We could learn a 
lot if we tuned in more. One day not long ago, I complained to my wife that the cleaners must 
have shrunk my pants. My wife gently smiled and poked me in the stomach to inform me that 
the pants had not shrunk, something else had expanded me! 

The game CASHFLOW was designed to give every player personal feedback. Its purpose is to 
give you options. If you draw the boat card and it puts you into debt, the question is, “Now what 
can you do?” How many different financial options can you come up with? That is the purpose 
of the game: to teach players to think and create new and various financial options. 

I have watched this game played by more than 1,000 people. The people who get out of the 
“Rat Race” in the game the quickest are the people who understand numbers and have creative 
financial minds. They recognize different financial options. People who take the longest are 
people who are not familiar with numbers and often do not understand the power of investing. 
Rich people are often creative and take calculated risks. 

There have been people playing CASHFLOW who gain lots of money in the game, but they 
don’t know what to do with it. Most of them have not been financially successful in real life 
either. Everyone else seems to be getting ahead of them, even though they have money. And 
that is true in real life. There are a lot of people who have a lot of money and do not get ahead 
financially.

CHAPTER SEVEN 


<div class=’story_text’>Lesson Six:Work to Learn -Don’t Work for Money</p> <div 
class=’story_text’>In 1995,1 granted an interview with a newspaper in Singapore. The young 
female reporter was on time, and the interview got under way immediately. We sat in the lobby 
of a luxurious hotel, sipping coffee and discussing the purpose of my visit to Singapore. I was to 
share the platform with Zig Ziglar. He was speaking on motivation, and I was speaking on “The 
Secrets of the Rich.”</p> <div class=’story_text’>“Someday, I would like to be a best-selling 
author like you,” she said. I had seen some of the articles she had written for the paper, and I 
was impressed. She had a tough, clear style of writing. Her articles held a reader’s interest. </p> 
<div class=’story_text’>“You have a great style,” I said in reply. “What holds you back from 
achieving your dream?”</p> <div class=’story_text’>“My work does not seem to go anywhere,” 
she said quietly. “Everyone says that my novels are excellent, but nothing happens. So I keep 
my job with the paper. At least it pays the bills. Do you have any suggestions?”</p> <div 
class=’story_text’>“Yes, I do,” I said brightly. “A friend of mine here in Singapore runs a school 
that trains people to sell. He runs sales-training courses for many of the top corporations here in 
Singapore, and I think attending one of his courses would greatly enhance your career. ”</p> 
<div class=’story_text’>She stiffened. “Are you saying I should go to school to learn to 
sell?”</p> <div class=’story_text’>I nodded. </p> <div class=’story_text’>“You aren’t serious, 
are you?”</p> <div class=’story_text’>Again, I nodded. “What is wrong with that?” I was now 
backpeddling. She was offended by something, and now I was wishing 11 had not said anything. 
In my attempt to be helpful, I found myself defending my suggestion. </p> <div 
class=’story_text’>“I have a master’s degree in English Literature. Why would I go to school to 
learn to be a salesperson? I am a professional. I went to school to be trained in a profession so I 
would not have to be a salesperson. I hate salespeople. All they want is money. So tell me why I 
I should study sales?” She was now packing her briefcase forcibly. The interview was over.</p> 
<div class=’story_text’>On the coffee table sat a copy of an earlier best-selling book I wrote. I I 
picked it up as well as the notes she had jotted down on her legal pad. I “Do you see this?” I 
said pointing to her notes. </p> <div class=’story_text’>She looked down at her notes. “What,” 
she said, confused. </p> <div class=’story_text’> Again, I pointed deliberately to her notes. On 
her pad she had written “Robert Kiyosaki, best-selling author. ”</p> <div class=’story_text’>“lt 
says ’best-selling author,’ not best ’writing’ author. ”</p> <div class=’story_text’>Her eyes 
widened immediately. </p> <div class=’story_text’>“I am a terrible writer. You are a great 
writer. I went to sales school. You have a master’s degree. Put them together and you get a 
’best-selling author’ and a ’best-writing author. ”’</p> <div class=’story_text’> Anger flared from 
her eyes. “I’ll never stoop so low as to learn how to sell. People like you have no business 
writing. I am a professionally trained writer and you are a salesman. It is not fair.”</p> <div 
class=’story_text’>The rest of her notes were put away, and she hurried out through the j, large 
glass doors into the humid Singapore morning. </p> <div class=’story_text’>At least she gave 
me a fair and favorable write-up the next morning. </p> <div class =’story_text’>The world is 
filled with smart, talented, educated and gifted people. We meet them every day. They are all 
around us.</p> <div class=’story_text’>A few days ago, my car was not running well. I pulled 
into a garage, and the young mechanic had it fixed in just a few minutes. He knew what was 


Page 70/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


wrong by simply listening to the engine. I was amazed. </p> <div class=’story_text’>The sad 
truth is, great talent is not enough. </p> <div class=’story_text’>I am constantly shocked at how 
little talented people earn. I heard the other day that less than 5 percent of Americans earn 
more than $100,000 a year. I have met brilliant, highly educated people who earn less than 
$20,000 a year. A business consultant who specializes in the medical trade was telling me how 
many doctors, dentists and chiropractors struggle financially. All this time, I thought that when 
they graduated, the dollars would pour in. It was this business consultant who gave me the 
phrase, “They are one skill away from great wealth. ”</p> <div class =’story_text’> What this 
phrase means is that most people need only to learn and master one more skill and their 
income would jump exponentially. I have mentioned before that financial intelligence is a 
synergy of accounting, investing, marketing and law. Combine those four technical skills and 
making money with money is easier. When it comes to money, the only skill most people know 
is to work hard.</p> <div class=’story_text’>The classic example of a synergy of skills was that 
young writer for the newspaper. If she diligently learned the skills of sales and marketing, her 
income would jump dramatically. If I were her, I would take some courses in advertising 
copywriting as well as sales. Then, instead of working at the newspaper, I would seek a job at an 
advertising agency. Even if it were a cut in pay, she would learn how to communicate in “short 
cuts” that are used in successful advertising. She also would spend time learning public relations, 
an important skill. She would learn how to get millions in free publicity. Then, at night and on 
weekends, she could be writing her great novel. When it was finished, she would be better able 
to sell her book. Then, in a short while, she could be a “best-selling author. ”</p> <div 
class=’story_text’>When I first came out with my first book If You Want To Be Rich and Happy, 
Don’t Go to School? a publisher suggested I change the tide to The Economics of Education. I 
told the publisher that with a title like that, I would sell two books: one to my family and one to 
my best friend. The problem is, they would expect it for free. The obnoxious title If You Want 
To Be Rich and Happy, Don’t Go to School? was chosen because we knew it would get tons of 
publicity. I am pro-education and believe in education reform. Otherwise, why would I continue 
to press for changing our antiquated educational system? So I chose a title that would get me on 
more TV and radio shows, simply because I was willing to be controversial. Many people 
thought I was a fruitcake, but the book sold and sold.</p> <div class=’story_text’>When I 
graduated from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in 1969, my educated dad was happy. 
Standard Oil of California had hired me for its oil-tanker fleet. I was a third mate, and the pay 
was low compared with my classmates, but it was OK for a first real job after college. My starting 
pay was about $42,000 a year, including overtime, and I only had , to work for seven months. I 
had five months of vacation. If I had wanted to, I could have taken the run to Vietnam with a 
subsidiary shipping company, and easily doubled my pay instead of taking the five J months’ 
vacation. </p> <div class=’story_text’>I had a great career ahead of me, yet I resigned after six 
months with the company and joined the Marine Corps to learn how to fly. My educated dad 
was devastated. Rich dad congratulated me.</p> <div class=’story_text’>In school and in the 
workplace, the popular opinion is the idea of “specialization.” That is, in order to make more 
money or get promoted, you need to “specialize.” That is why medical doctors immediately 
begin to seek a specialty such as orthopedics or pediatrics. The same is true for accountants, 
architects, lawyers, pilots and others. </p> <div class=’story_text’>My educated dad believed in 
the same dogma. That is why he was thrilled when he eventually achieved his doctorate. He 
often admitted ; that schools reward people who study more and more about less and less.</p> 
<div class=’story_text’>Rich dad encouraged me to do exactly the opposite. “You want to

know a little about a lot” was his suggestion. That is why for years I worked in different areas of 
his companies. For awhile, I worked in his accounting department. Although I would probably 
never have been an accountant, he wanted me to learn via “osmosis.” Rich dad knew I would 
pick up “jargon” and a sense of what is important and what is not. I also worked as a bus boy 
and construction worker, as well as in sales, reservations and marketing. He was “grooming” 
Mike and me. That is why he insisted we sit in on the meetings with his bankers, lawyers, 
accountants and brokers. He wanted us to know a little about every aspect of his empire. </p> 
<div class=’story_text’>When I quit my high-paying job with Standard Oil, my educated dad had 
a heart-to-heart with me. He was bewildered. He could not understand my decision to resign 
from a career that offered high pay, great benefits, lots of time off, and opportunity for 
promotion. When he asked me one evening, “Why did you quit?” I could not explain it to him, 
as much as I tried. My logic did not fit his logic. The big problem wasthat my logic was my rich 
dad’s logic. </p> <div class=’story_text’>Job security meant everything to my educated dad. 
Learning meant everything to my rich dad.</p> <div class=’story_text’>Educated dad thought I 
went to school to learn to be a ship’s officer. Rich dad knew that I went to school to study 
international trade. So as a student, 1 made cargo runs, navigating large freighters, oil tankers 
and passenger ships to the Far East and the South Pacific. Rich dad emphasized that I stay in 
the Pacific instead of taking ships to Europe because he knew that the “emerging nations” were 
in Asia, not Europe. While most of my classmates, including Mike, were partying at their 
fraternity houses, I was studying trade, people, business styles and cultures in Japan, Taiwan, 
Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Korea, Tahiti, Samoa and the Philippines. I also 
was partying, but it was not in any frat house. I grew up rapidly. </p> <div 
class=’story_text’>Educated dad just could not understand why I decided to quit and join the 
Marine Corps. I told him I wanted to learn to fly, but really I wanted to learn to lead troops. Rich 
dad explained to me that the hardest part of running a company is managing people. He had 
spent three years in the Army; my educated dad was draft-exempt. Rich dad told me of the 
value of learning to lead men into dangerous situations. “Leadership is what you need to learn 
next,” he said. “If you’re not a good leader, you’ll get shot in the back, just like they do in 
business. ”</p> <div class=’story_text’>Returning from Vietnam in 1973,1 resigned my 
commission, even though I loved flying. I found a job with Xerox Corp. I joined it for one 
reason, and it was not for the benefits. I was a shy person, and the thought of selling was the 
most frightening subject in the world. Xerox has one of the best sales-training programs in 
America. </p> <div class=’story_text’>Rich dad was proud of me. My educated dad was 
ashamed. Being an intellectual, he thought that salespeople were below him. I worked with 
Xerox for four years until I overcame my fear of knocking on doors and being rejected. Once I 
could consistently be in the top five in sales, I again resigned and moved on, leaving behind 
another great career with an excellent company. </p> <div class=’story_text’>In 1977,1 formed 
my first company. Rich dad had groomed Mike and me to take over companies. So I now had to 
learn to form them and put them together. My first product, the nylon and velcro wallet, was 
manufactured in the Far East and shipped to a warehouse in New York, near where I had gone 
to school. My formal education was complete, and it was time to test my wings. If I failed, I went 
broke. Rich dad</p> <div class=’story_text’>thought it best to go broke before 30. “You still 
have time to recover” </p> <div class=’story_text’>was his advice. On the eve of my 30th 
birthday, my first shipment left ,,</p> <div class=’story_text’>Korea for New York.</p> <div 
class=’story_text’>Today, I still do business internationally. And as my rich dad encouraged me 
to do, I keep seeking the emerging nations. Today my investment company invests in South

America, Asia, Norway and Russia. There is an old cliche that goes, “Job is an acronym for ’Just 
Over Broke.’” And unfortunately, I would say that the saying applies to millions of people. 
Because school does not think financial intelligence is an intelligence, most workers “live within 
their means.” They work and they pay the bills. </p> <div class=’story_text’>There is another 
horrible management theory that goes, “Workers work hard enough to not be fired, and owners 
pay just enough so that workers won’t quit.” And if you look at the pay scales of most 
companies, again I would say there is a degree of truth in that statement. </p> <div 
class=’story_text’>The net result is that most workers never get ahead. They do what they’ve 
been taught to do: “Get a secure job.” Most workers focus on working for pay and benefits that 
reward them in the short term, but is often disastrous in the long. Instead I recommend to young 
people to seek work for what they will learn, more than what they will earn. Look down the 
road at what ; skills they want to acquire before choosing a specific profession and before 
getting trapped in the “Rat Race.”</p> <div class=’story_text’>Once people are trapped in the 
lifelong process of bill paying, they 1 become like those little hamsters running around in those 
little metal wheels. Their little furry legs are spinning furiously, the wheel is turning furiously, but 
come tomorrow morning, they’ll still be in the same cage: great job.</p> <div 
class=’story_text’>In the movie Jerry Maguire, starring Tom Cruise, there are many great one 
liners. Probably the most memorable is “Show me the money.” But there is one line I thought 
most truthful. It comes from the scene where Tom Cruise is leaving the firm. He has just been 
fired, and he is asking the entire company “Who wants to come with me?” And the whole place 

is silent and frozen. Only one woman speaks up and says, “I’d like to but I’m due for a 

promotion in three months. ”</p> <div class=’story_text’>That statement is probably the most 
truthful statement in the whole movie. It is the type of statement that people use to keep 
themselves</p> <div class=’story_text’>busy working away to pay bills. I know my educated 
dad looked forward to his pay raise every year, and every year he was disappointed. So he 
would go back to school to earn more qualifications so he could get another raise, but again, it 
would be another disappointment. </p> <div class=’story_text’>The question I often ask people 
is, “Where is this daily activity taking you?” Just like the little hamster, I wonder if people look at 

where their hard work is taking them. What does the future hold?</p> <div 

class=’story_text’>Cyril Brickfield, the former executive director of The American Association of 
Retired People, reports that “private pensions are in a state of chaos. First of all, 50 percent of 
the workforce today has no pension. That alone should be of great concern. And 75 to 80 
percent of the other 50 percent have ineffective pensions that pay $55 or $150 or $300 a 
month. ”</p> <div class=’story_text’>In his book The Retirement Myth, Craig S. Karpel writes: 
“I visited the headquarters of a major national pension consulting firm and met with a managing 
director who specializes in designing lush retirement plans for top management. When I asked 
her what people who don’t have corner offices will be able to expect in the way of pension 
income, she said with a confident smile: ’’The Silver Bullet. ’</p> <div class=’story_text’>" 
’What,’ I asked, ’is The Silver Bullet?’</p> <div class=’story_text’>“She shrugged, ’If baby 
boomers discover they don’t have enough money to live on when they’re older, they can always 
blow their brains out.’” Karpel goes on to explain the difference between the old Defined 
Benefit retirement plans and the new 401K plans which are riskier. It is not a pretty picture for 
most people working today. And that is just for retirement. When medical fees and long-term 
nursing home care are added to the picture, the picture is frightening. In his 1995 book, he 
indicates that nursing-home fees run from $30,000 to $125,000 per year. He went to a clean 
no-frills nursing home in his area and found the price to be $88,000 a year in 1995. </p> <div

class=’story_text’>Already, many hospitals in countries with socialized medicine need to make 
tough decisions such as “Who will live and who will die?” They make those decisions purely on 
how much money they have and how old the patients are. If the patient is old, they often will 
give the medical care to someone younger. The older poor patient gets put to the back of the 
line. So just as the rich can afford better education, the rich will be able to keep themselves 
alive, while those who have little wealth will die.</p> <div class=’story_text’>So I wonder, are 
workers looking into the future or just until their next paycheck, never questioning where they 
are headed?</p> <div class =’story_text’> When I speak to adults who want to earn more 
money, I always recommend the same thing. I suggest taking a long view of their life. Instead of 
simply working for the money and security, which I admit are important, I suggest they take a 
second job that will teach them a second skill. Often 1 recommend joining a network marketing 
company, also called multilevel marketing, if they want to learn sales skills. Some of these 
companies have excellent training programs that help people get over their fear of failure and 
rejection, which are the main reasons people /) are unsuccessful. Education is more valuable 
than money, in the long run.</p> <div class=’story_text’>When I offer this suggestion, I often 
hear in response, “Oh that is too much hassle,” or “I only want to do what I am interested 
in.”</p> <div class=’story_text’>To the statement of “It’s too much of a hassle,” I ask, “So you 
would ; rather work all your life giving 50 percent of what you earn to the government’” To the 
other statement-“I only do what I am interested in”-l say, “I’m not interested in going to the 
gym, but I go because I want to feel better and live longer. ”</p> <div 
class=’story_text’>Unfortunately, there is some truth to the old statement “You can’t teach an 
old dog new tricks.” Unless a person is used to changing, it’s hard to change. </p> <div 
class=’story_text’>But for those of you who might be on the fence when it comes to the idea of 
working to learn something new, I offer this word of encouragement: Life is much like going to 
the gym. The most painful part is deciding to go. Once you get past that, it’s easy. There have 
been many days I have dreaded going to the gym, but once I am there and in motion, it is a 
pleasure. After the workout is over, I am always glad I talked myself into going. </p> <div 
class=’story_text’>lf you are unwilling to work to learn something new and insist on, instead, 
becoming highly specialized within your field, make sure the company you work for is unionized. 
Labor unions are designed to protect specialists. </p> <div class=’story_text’>My educated dad, 
after falling from grace with the governor, became the head of the teachers union in Hawaii. He 
told me that it was the hardest job he ever held. My rich dad, on the other hand, spent his life 
doing his best to keep his companies from becoming unionized. He was successful. Although 
the unions came close, rich dad was always able to fight them off.</p> <div 
class=’story_text’>Personally, I take no sides because I can see the need for and the benefits of 
both sides. If you do as school recommends, become highly specialized, then seek union 
protection. Lor example, had I continued on with my flying career, I would have sought a 
company that had a strong pilots union. Why? Because my life would be dedicated to learn a 
skill that was valuable in only one industry. If 1 were pushed out of that industry, my life’s skills 
would not be as valuable to another industry. A displaced senior pilot-with 100,000 hours of 
heavy airline transport time, earning $150,000 a year-would have a hard time finding an 
equivalent high-paying job in school teaching. The skills do not necessarily transfer from industry 
to industry, because the skills the pilots are paid for in the airline industry are not as important 
in, say, the school system. </p> <div class=’story_text’>The same is true even for doctors today. 
With all the changes in medicine, many medical specialists are needing to conform to medical 
organizations such as HMO’s. Schoolteachers definitely need to be union members. Today in

America, the teachers union is the largest and the richest labor union of all. The NEA, National 
Education Association, has tremendous political clout. Teachers need the protection of their 
union because their skills are also of limited value to an industry outside of education. So the rule 
of thumb is, “Highly specialized, then unionize.” It’s the smart thing to do.</p> <div 
class=’story_text’>When I ask the classes I teach, “How many of you can cook a better 
hamburger than McDonald’s?” almost all the students raise their hands. I then ask, “So if most 
of you can cook a better hamburger, how come McDonald’s makes more money than 
you?”</p> <div class =’story_text’>The answer is obvious: McDonald’s is excellent at business 
systems. The reason so many talented people are poor is because they focus on building a 
better hamburger and know little to nothing about business systems. </p> <div 
class=’story_text’>A friend of mine in Hawaii is a great artist. He makes a sizable amount of 
money. One day his mother’s attorney called to tell him that she had left him $35,000. That is 
what was left of her estate after the attorney and the government took their shares. 
Immediately, he saw an opportunity to increase his business by using some of this money to 
advertise. Two months later, his first four-color, full-page ad appeared in an expensive magazine 
that targeted the very rich. The ad ran for three months. He received no replies from the ad, 
and all of his inheritance is now gone. He now wants to sue the magazine for 
misrepresentation. </p> <div class=’story_text’>This is a common case of someone who can 
build a beautiful hamburger, but knows little about business. When I asked him what he learned, 
his only reply was that “advertising salespeople are crooks.” I then asked him if he would be 
willing to take a course in sales and a course in direct marketing. His reply, “I don’t have the 
time, and I don’t want to waste my money. ”</p> <div class =’story_text’>The world is filled with 
talented poor people. All too often, they’re poor or struggle financially or earn less than they 
are capable of, not f because of what they know but because of what they do not know. They 
focus on perfecting their skills at building a better hamburger rather than the skills of selling and 
delivering the hamburger. Maybe McDonald’s does not make the best hamburger, but they are 
the best at f selling and delivering a basic average burger. </p> <div class=’story_text’>Poor dad 
wanted me to specialize. That was his view on how to be paid more. Even after being told by 
the governor of Hawaii that he could no longer work in state government, my educated dad 
continued to encourage me to get specialized. Educated dad then took up the cause of the 
teachers union, campaigning for further protection and benefits for I these highly skilled and 
educated professionals. We argued often, but I know he never agreed that overspecialization is 
what caused the need for union protection. He never understood that the more specialized you 
become, the more you are trapped and dependent on that specialty. </p> <div 
class=’story_text’>Rich dad advised that Mike and I “groom” ourselves. Many corporations do 
the same thing. They find a young bright student out of business school and begin “grooming” 
that person to someday take over the company. So these bright young employees do not 
specialize in one department; they are moved from department to department to learn all the 
aspects of business systems. The rich often “groom” their children or the children of others. By 
doing so, their children gain an overall knowledge of the operations of the business and how the 
various departments interrelate.</p> <div class=’story_text’>For the World War II generation, it 
was considered “bad” to skip from company to company. Today, it is considered smart. Since 
people will skip from company to company, rather than seek greater specialization, why not 
seek to “learn” more than “earn.” In the short term, it may earn you less. In the long term, it 
will pay off in large dividends. </p> <div class=’story_text’>The main management skills needed 
for success are:</p> <div class=’story_text’>l.D The management of cash flow</p> <div 


Page 75/114

Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


class='story_text'>2.n The management of systems (including yourself and time with 
family). </p> <div class='story_text>3. The management of people. </p> <div 
class=’story_text’>The most important specialized skills are sales and understanding marketing. 
It is the ability to sell--therefore, to communicate to another human being, be it a customer, 
employee, boss, spouse or child-that is the base skill of personal success. It is communication 
skills such as writing, speaking and negotiating that are crucial to a life of success. It is a skill that 
I work on constantly, attending courses or buying educational tapes to expand my 
knowledge. </p> <div class=’story_text’>As 1 have mentioned, my educated dad worked harder 
and harder the more competent he became. He also became more trapped the more 
specialized he got. Although his salary went up, his choices diminished. Soon after he was 
locked out of government work, he found out how vulnerable he really was professionally. It is 
like professional athletes who suddenly are injured or are too old to play. Their once high-paying 
position is gone, and they have limited skills to fall back on. I think that is why my educated dad 
sided so much with unions after that. He realized how much a union would have benefited 
him.</p> <div class=’story_text’>Rich dad encouraged Mike and me to know a little about a lot. 
He encouraged us to work with people smarter than we were and to bring smart people 
together to work as a team. Today it would be called a synergy of professional specialities. </p> 
<div class=’story_text’>Today, I meet ex-schoolteachers earning hundreds of thousands of 
dollars a year. They earn that much because they have specialized skills in their field as well as 
other skills. They can teach as well as sell and market. I know of no other skills to be more 
important than selling as well as marketing. The skills of selling and marketing are difficult for 
most people primarily due to their fear of rejection. The better you are at communicating, 
negotiating and handling your fear of rejection, the easier life is. Just as I advised that 
newspaper writer who wanted to become a “best-selling author,” I advise anyone else today. 
Being technically specialized has its strengths as well as its weaknesses. I have friends who are 
geniuses, but they cannot communicate effectively with other human beings and, as a result, 
their earnings are pitiful. I advise them to just spend a year learning to sell. Even if they earn 
nothing, their communication skills will improve. And that is priceless. </p> <div 
class=’story_text’>In addition to being good learners, sellers and marketers, we need to be good 
teachers as well as good students. To be truly rich, we need to be able to give as well as to 
receive. In cases of financial or professional struggle, there is often a lack of giving and 
receiving. I know many people who are poor because they are neither good students nor good 
teachers. </p> <div class=’story_text’>Both of my dads were generous men. Both made it a 
practice to give first. Teaching was one of their ways of giving. The more they gave, the more 
they received. One glaring difference was in the giving of money. My rich dad gave lots of 
money away. He gave to his church, to charities, to his foundation. He knew that to receive 
money, you had to give money. Giving money is the secret to most great wealthy families. That 
is why there are organizations like the Rockefeller Foundation and the Ford Foundation. These 
are organizations designed to take their wealth and increase it, as well as give it away in 
perpetuity. </p> <div class=’story_text’>My educated dad always said, “When 1 have some extra 
money, I’ll give it.” The problem was, there was never any extra. So he worked harder to draw 
more money in rather than focus on the most important law of money: “Give and you shall 
receive.” Instead, he believed in “Receive and then you give.”</p> <div class=’story_text’>In 
conclusion, I became both dads. One part of me is a hard-core capitalist who loves the game of 
money making money. The other side is a socially responsible teacher who is deeply 
concerned with this ever-widening gap between the haves and have nots. I personally hold the

CHAPTER EIGHT 


Overcoming Obstacles 

Once people have studied and become financially literate, they may still face roadblocks to 
becoming financially independent. There are five main reasons why financially literate people 
may still not develop abundant asset columns. Asset columns that could produce large sums of 
cash flow. Asset columns that could free them to live the life they dream of, instead of working 
full time just to pay bills. The five reasons are: 

1. D Fear. 

2 . D Cynicism. 

3. D Laziness. 

4. D Bad habits. 

5. D Arrogance. 

Reason No. 1. Overcoming the fear of losing money. I have never met anyone who really likes 
losing money. And in all my years, I have never met a rich person who has never lost money. 
But I have met a lot of poor people who have never lost a dime. . .investing, that is. 

The fear of losing money is real. Everyone has it. Even the rich. But it’s not fear that is the 
problem. It’s how you handle fear. It’s how you handle losing. It’s how you handle failure that 
makes the difference in one’s life. That goes for anything in life, not just money. The primary 
difference between a rich person and a poor person is how they handle that fear. 

It’s OK to be fearful. It’s OK to be a coward when it comes to money. You can still be rich. 
We’re all heroes at something and cowards at something else. My friend’s wife is an emergency 
room nurse. When ; she sees blood, she flies into action. When I mention investing, she runs’j 
away. When I see blood, I don’t run. I pass out. My rich dad understood phobias about money. 
“Some people are terrified of snakes. Some people are terrified about losing money. Both are 
phobias,” he would say. So his solution to the phobia of losing money was this little rhyme: “If 
you hate risk and worry. . .start early.” 

That’s why banks recommend savings as a habit when you’re young. J If you start young, it’s 
easy to be rich. I won’t go into it here, but there is a large difference between a person who 
starts saving at age 20 versus age 30. A staggering difference. 

It is said that one of the wonders of the world is the power of compound interest. The purchase 
of Manhattan Island is said to be one of the greatest bargains of all time. New York was 
purchased for $24 in trinkets and beads. Yet, if that $24 had been invested, at 8 percent 
annually, that $24 would have been worth more than $28 trillion by 1995, Manhattan could be 
repurchased with money left over to buy much of L.A., especially at 1995’s real estate prices.

My neighbor works for a major computer company. He has been there 25 years. In five more 
years he will leave the company with $4 million in his 401k retirement plan. It is invested mostly 
in high-growth mutual funds, which he will convert to bonds and government securities. He’ll 
only be 55 when he gets out, and he will have -a passive cash flow of over $300,000 a year, 
more than he makes from his salary. So it can be done, even if you hate losing or hate risk. But 
you must start early and definitely set up a retirement plan, and you should hire a financial 
planner you trust to guide you before investing in anything. 

But what if you don’t have much time left or would like to retire early? How do you handle the 
fear of losing money? 

My poor dad did nothing. He simply avoided the issue, refusing to discuss the subject. 

My rich dad, on the other hand, recommended that I think like a Texan. “I like Texas and 
Texans,” he used to say. “In Texas, everything is bigger. When Texans win, they win big. And 
when they lose, it’s spectacular.” 

“They like losing?” I asked. 

“That’s not what I’m saying. Nobody likes losing. Show me a happy loser, and I’ll show you a 
loser,” said rich dad. “It’s a Texan’s attitude toward risk, reward and failure I’m talking about. It’s 
how they handle life. They live it big. Not like most of the people around here, living like 
roaches when it comes to money. Roaches terrified that someone will shine a light on them. 
Whimpering when the grocery clerk short changes them a quarter.” 

Rich dad went on to explain. 

“What I like best is the Texas attitude. They’re proud when they win, and they brag when they 
lose. Texans have a saying, "If you’re going to go broke, go big. You don’t want to admit you 
went broke over a duplex. Most people around here are so afraid of losing, they don’t have a 
duplex to go broke with. 1 ' 

He constantly told Mike and me that the greatest reason for lack of financial success was 
because most people played it too safe. “People are so afraid of losing that they lose” were his 
words. 

Fran Tarkenton, a one-time great NFL quarterback, says it still another way: “Winning means 
being unafraid to lose.” In my own life, I’ve noticed that winning usually follows losing. Before I 
finally learned to ride a bike, I first fell down many times. I’ve never met a 

golfer who has never lost a golf ball. I’ve never met people who have fallen in love who have 
never had their heart broken. And I’ve never met someone rich who has never lost money. 

So for most people, the reason they don’t win financially is because the pain of losing money is 
far greater than the joy of being rich. Another saying in Texas is, “Everyone wants to go to 
Heaven, but no one wants to die.” Most people dream of being rich, but are terrified of losing 
money. So they never get to Heaven. 

Rich dad used to tell Mike and me stories about his trips to Texas. “If you really want to learn 
the attitude of how to handle risk, losing and failure, go to San Antonio and visit the Alamo. The 


Page 79/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


Alamo is a great story of brave people who chose to fight, knowing there was no hope of 
success against overwhelming odds. They chose to die instead of surrendering. It’s an inspiring 
story worthy of study; nonetheless, it’s still a tragic military defeat. They got their butts kicked. A 
failure if you will. They lost. So how do Texans handle failure? They still shout, ’Remember the 
Alamo!”’ 

Mike and I heard this story a lot. He always told us this story when f he was about to go into a 
big deal and he was nervous. After he had done all his due diligence and now it was put up or 
shut up, he told us this story. Every time he was afraid of making a mistake, or losing money, he 
told us this story. It gave him strength, for it reminded him that he could always turn a financial 
loss into a financial win. Rich dad I knew that failure would only make him stronger and smarter. 
It’s not that! he wanted to lose; he just knew who he was and how he would take a loss. He 
would take a loss and make it a win. That’s what made him a winner and others losers. It gave 
him the courage to cross the line when others backed out. “That’s why I like Texans so much. 
They took a great failure and turned it into a tourist destination that makes them millions.” 

But probably his words that mean the most to me today are these: “Texans don’t bury their 
failures. They get inspired by them. They take i their failures and turn them into rallying cries. 
Failure inspires Texans to ’ become winners. But that formula is not just the formula for Texans. 
It j is the formula for all winners.” 

Just as I also said that falling off my bike was part of learning to ride. I remember falling off only 
made me more determined to learn to ride. Not less. I also said that I have never met a golfer 
who has never lost a ball. To be a top professional golfer, losing a ball or a tournament only 
inspires golfers to be better, to practice harder, to study more. That’s what makes them better. 
For winners, losing inspires them. For losers, losing defeats them. 

Quoting John D. Rockefeller, “I always tried to turn every disaster ’ into an opportunity.” 

And being Japanese-American, I can say this. Many people say that Pearl Harbor was an 
American mistake. I say it was a Japanese mistake. From the movie Tora, Tora, Tom, a somber 
Japanese admiral says to his cheering subordinates, “I am afraid we have awakened a sleeping 
giant.” “Remember Pearl Harbor” became a rallying cry. It turned one of America’s greatest 
losses into the reason to win. This great defeat gave America strength, and America soon 
emerged as a world power. 

Failure inspires winners. And failure defeats losers. It is the biggest secret of winners. It’s the 
secret that losers do not know. The greatest secret of winners is that failure inspires winning; 
thus, they’re not afraid of losing. Repeating Fran Tarkenton’s quote, “Winning means being 
unafraid to lose.” People like Fran Tarkenton are not afraid of losing because they know who 
they are. They hate losing, so they know that losing will only inspire them to become better. 
There is a big difference between hating losing and being afraid to lose. Most people are so 
afraid of losing money that they lose. They go broke over a duplex. Financially they play life too 
safe and too small. They buy big houses and big cars, but not big investments. The main reason 
that over 90 percent of the American public struggles financially is because they play not to 
lose. They don’t play to win. 

They go to their financial planners or accountants or stockbrokers and buy a balanced portfolio. 


Page 80/114

Most have lots of cash in CDs, low-yield bonds, mutual funds that can be traded within a mutual- 
fund family, and a few individual stocks. It is a safe and sensible portfolio. But it is not a winning 
portfolio. It is a portfolio of someone playing not to lose. 

Don’t get me wrong. It’s probably a better portfolio than more than 70 percent of the 
population, and that’s frightening. Because a safe portfolio is a lot better than no portfolio. It’s a 
great portfolio for someone who loves safely. But playing it safe and going “balanced” on your 
investment portfolio is not the way successful investors play the game. If you have little money 
and you want to be rich, you must first be “focused,” not “balanced.” If you look at anyone 
successful, at the start they were not balanced. Balanced people go nowhere. They stay in one 
spot. To make progress, you must first go unbalanced. Just look at how you make progress 
walking. 

Thomas Edison was not balanced. He was focused. Bill Gates was not balanced. He was 
focused. Donald Trump is focused. George Soros is focused. George Patton did not take his 
tanks wide. He focused them and blew through the weak spots in the German line. The French 
went wide with the Maginot Line, and you know what happened to them. 

If you have any desire of being rich, you must focus. Put a lot of your eggs in a few baskets. Do 
not do what poor and middle class people do: put their few eggs in many baskets. 

If you hate losing, play it safe. If losing makes you weak, play it safe. Go with balanced 
investments. If you’re over 25 years old and are terrified of taking risks, don’t change. Play it 
safe, but start early. Start accumulating your nest egg early because it will take time. 

But if you have dreams of freedom-of getting out of the rat race- the first question to ask 
yourself is, “How do I respond to failure?” If failure inspires you to win, maybe you should go for 
it-but only maybe. If failure makes you weak or causes you to throw temper tantrums-like spoiled 
brats who call an attorney to file a lawsuit every time something does not go their way-then play 
it safe. Keep your daytime job. Or buy bonds or mutual funds. But remember, there is risk in 
those financial instruments also, even though they are safer. 

I say all this, mentioning Texas and Fran Tarkenton, because stacking the asset column is easy. 
It’s really a low-aptitude game. It doesn’t take much education. Fifth-grade math will do. But 
staking the asset column ’J is a high-attitude game. It takes guts, patience and a great attitude 
toward failure. Losers avoid failing. And failure turns losers into winners.” Just remember the 
Alamo. 

Reason No. 2. Overcoming cynicism. “The sky is falling. The sky is falling.” Most of us know the 
story of “Chicken Little,” who ran around warning the barnyard of impending doom. We all 
know people who are that way. But we all have a “Chicken Little” inside each of us. 

And as I stated earlier, the cynic is really a little chicken. We all get a little chicken when fear 
and doubt cloud our thoughts. 

All of us have doubts. “I’m not smart.” “I’m not good enough.” “So ’$ and so is better than me.” 
Or our doubts often paralyze us. We play the. I “What if?” game. “What if the economy 
crashes right after I invest?” Or “What if I lose control and I can’t pay the money back?” “What 
if things don’t go as I planned?” Or we have friends or loved ones who will remind us of our 


Page 81/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


shortcomings regardless of whether we ask. They often say, “What makes you think you can do 
that?” Or “If it’s such a good idea, how come someone else hasn’t done it?” Or “That will never 
work. You don’t know what you’re talking about.” These words of doubt often get so loud that 
we fail to act. A horrible feeling builds in our stomach. Sometimes we can’t sleep. We fail to 
move forward. So we stay with what is safe and opportunities pass us by. We watch life passing 
by as we sit immobilized with a cold knot in our body. We have all felt this at one time in our 
lives, some more than others. 

Peter Lynch of Fidelity Magellan mutual fund fame refers to warnings about the sky falling as 
“noise,” and we all hear it. 

“Noise” is either created inside our heads or comes from outside. Often from friends, family, co- 
workers and the media. Lynch recalls the time during the 1950s when the threat of nuclear war 
was so prevalent in the news that people began building fallout shelters and storing food and 
water. If they had invested that money wisely in the market, instead of building a fallout shelter, 
they’d probably be financially independent today. 

When the riots broke out in Los Angeles a few years ago, gun sales went up all over the 
country. A person dies from rare hamburger meat in Washington State and the Arizona Health 
Department orders restaurants to have all beef cooked well-done. A drug company runs a 
national TV commercial showing people catching the flu. The ad runs in February. Colds go up 
as well as sales of their cold medicine. 

Most people are poor because when it comes to investing, the world is filled with Chicken Littles 
running around yelling, “The sky is falling. The sky is falling.” And Chicken Littles are effective 
because everyone of us is a little chicken. It often takes great courage to not let rumors and talk 
of doom and gloom affect your doubts and fears. 

In 1992, a friend named Richard came from Boston to visit my wife and me in Phoenix. He was 
impressed with what we had done through stocks and real estate. The prices of real estate in 
Phoenix were depressed. We spent two days with him showing him what we thought were 
excellent opportunities for cash flow and capital appreciation. 

My wife and I are not real estate agents. We are strictly investors. After identifying a unit in a 
resort community, we called an agent who sold it to him that afternoon. The price was a mere 
$42,000 for a two-bedroom townhome. Similar units were going for $65,000. He had found a 
bargain. Excited, he bought it and returned to Boston. 

Two weeks later, the agent called to say that our friend had backed out. I called immediately to 
find out why. All he said was that he talked to his neighbor, and his neighbor told him it was a 
bad deal. He was paying too much. 

I asked Richard if his neighbor was an investor. Richard said “no.” When I asked why he listened 
to him, Richard got defensive and simply said he wanted to keep looking. 

The real estate market in Phoenix turned, and by 1994, that little unit was renting for $1,000 a 
month-$2,500 in the peak winter months. The unit was worth $95,000 in 1995. All Richard 
had to put down was $5,000 and he would have had a start at getting out of the rat race. 
Today, he still has done nothing. And the bargains in Phoenix are still here; you just have to 


Page 82/114 


http : / / motsach . info 


Rich Dad Poor Dad 


Robert T. Kiyosaki 


look a lot harder. 

Richard’s backing out did not surprise me. It’s called “buyer’s remorse,” and it affects all of us. 
It’s those doubts that get us. The little 1 chicken won, and a chance at freedom was lost. 

In another example, I hold a small portion of my assets in tax lien certificates instead of CDs. I 
earn 16 percent per year on my money, which certainly beats the 5 percent the bank offers. 
The certificates are secured by real estate and enforced by state law, which is also better than 
most banks. The formula they’re bought on makes them safe. They just lack liquidity. So I look 
at them as 2 to 7-year CDs. Almost every time I tell someone, especially if they have money in 
CDs, that I hold my money this way, they will tell me it’s risky. They tell me why I should not do 
it. When I ask them where they get their information, they say from a friend or an investment 
magazine. They’ve never done it, and they’re telling someone who’s doing it why they 
shouldn’t. The lowest I yield I look for is 16 percent, but people who are filled with doubt are 
willing to accept 5 percent. Doubt is expensive. 

My point is that it’s those doubts and cynicism that keep most people? poor and playing it safe. 
The real world is simply waiting for you to get rich. Only a person’s doubts keep them poor. As I 
said, getting out of the rat race is technically easy. It doesn’t take much education, but those 
doubts are cripple rs for most people. 

“Cynics never win,” said rich dad. “Unchecked doubt and fear creates i a cynic. Cynics criticize, 
and winners analyze” was another of his favorite sayings. Rich dad explained that criticism 
blinded while analysis opened -< eyes. Analysis allowed winners to see that critics were blind, 
and to see opportunities that everyone else missed. And finding what people miss is I key to 
any success. 

Real estate is a powerful investment tool for anyone seeking financial independence or 
freedom. It is a unique investment tool. Yet, every time I mention real estate as a vehicle, I 
often hear, “I don’t want to fix toilets.” 

That’s what Peter Lynch calls “noise.” That’s what my rich dad would say is the cynic talking. 
Someone who criticizes and does not 

analyze. Someone who lets their doubts and fears close their mind instead of open their eyes.” 

So when someone says, “I don’t want to fix toilets,” I want to fire back, “What makes you think I 
want to?” They’re saying a toilet is more important than what they want. I talk about freedom 
from the rat race, and they focus on toilets. That is the thought pattern that keeps most people 
poor. They criticize instead of analyze. 

’I don’t wants’ hold the key to your success,” rich dad would say. 

Because I, too, do not want to fix toilets, I shop hard for a property manager who does fix 
toilets. And by finding a great property manager who runs houses or apartments, well, my cash 
flow goes up. But more importantly a great property manager allows me to buy a lot more real 
estate since I don’t have to fix toilets. A great property manager is key to success in real estate. 
Finding a good manager is more important to me than the real estate. A great property 
manager often hears of great deals before real estate agents do, which makes them even more

That is what rich dad meant by “ I don’t wants’ hold the key to your success.” Because I do not 
want to fix toilets either, I figured out how to buy more real estate and expedite my getting out 
of the rat race. The people who continue to say “I don’t want to fix toilets” often deny 
themselves the use of this powerful investment vehicle. Toilets are more important than their 
freedom. 

In the stock market, I often hear people say, "I don’t want to lose money.” Well, what makes 
them think I or anyone else likes losing money? They don’t make money because they chose to 
not lose money. Instead of analyzing, they close their minds to another powerful investment 
vehicle, the stock market. 

In December 1996,1 was riding with a friend past our neighborhood gas station. He looked up 
and saw that the price of oil was going up. My friend is a worry wart or a “Chicken Little.” To 
him, the sky is always going to fall, and it usually does, on him. 

When we got home, he showed me all the stats as to why the price of oil was going to go up 
over the next few years. Statistics I had never seen before, even though I already owned a 
substantial share block of an existing oil company. With that information, I immediately began 
looking for and found a new undervalued oil company that was about to find some oil deposits. 
My broker was excited about this new company, and I bought 15,000 shares for 65 cents per 
share . 

In February 1997, this same friend and I drove by the same gas station, and sure enough, the 
price per gallon had gone up nearly 15 percent. Again, the “Chicken Little” worried and 
complained. I smiled because in January 1997, that little oil company hit oil and those 15,000 
shares went up to more than $3 per share since he had first given me the tip. And the price of 
gas will continue to go up if what my friend says is true. 

Instead of analyzing, their little chicken closes their mind. If most people understood how a 
“stop” worked in stock-market investing, there would be more people -investing to win instead 
of investing not to lose. A “stop” is simply a computer command that sells your stock 
automatically if the price begins to drop, helping to minimize your losses and maximize some 
gains. It’s a great tool for those who are terrified of losing. 

So whenever I hear people focusing on their “I don’t wants,” rather than what they do want, I 
know the “noise” in their head must be loud. Chicken Little has taken over their brain and is 
yelling, “The sky is falling and toilets are breaking.” So they avoid their “don’t wants,” but they 
pay a huge price. They may never get what they want in life. 

Rich dad gave me a way of looking at Chicken Little. “Just do what Colonel Sanders did.” At the 
age of 66, he lost his business and began to live on his Social Security check. It wasn’t enough. 
He went around, the country selling his recipe for fried chicken. He was turned down 1,009 
times before someone said “yes.” And he went on to become a 

multimillionaire at an age when most people are quitting. “He was a brave and tenacious man,” 
rich dad said of Harlan Sanders.
